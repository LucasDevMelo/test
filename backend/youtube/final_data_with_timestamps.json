    "text": "welcome to Profectus AI the platform for building trading bots on MetaTrader 5 this video is part of a six bot portfolio we discovered on youtube inspired by trader renee balk four of those systems follow the so called turn around tuesday logic trading indices like the's p 500 the german 40 the us 100 and the us 30 you'll find the complete portfolio overview and its article linked down below as always please note past performance is not a promise of future returns in this video we'll build the us 30 version step by step so you'll not only see how the strategy works in detail but also learn the nitty-gritties of constructing it in our builder knowledge you can directly apply when developing your own systems so the portfolio consists out of six trading bots four of them are the so called turn around tuesday which is running on four pairs among others on the's p 500 the top 40 in germany the top 100 uh in the us and the top 30 in the us as well and the nming is always a little bit different for these assets per broker sometimes they're called tech 30 uh for instance so i suggest you to check out the help center article which is linked down below in the video description now let's build the first trading bot which is trading the us 30 and the logic for all of them is the same when we have monday check if the last friday was a bearish close day then we simply check if friday close is below the daily 40 period exponential moving average and then we simply buy at 1 am 105 in the morning on monday no stop loss and no take profit why is that viable well we simply close the trade on tuesday evening after 900 pm and 50 minutes and now let's simply build this trading system step by step number one we will define when to run the trading system so we simply take here the run at time block drag and drop it on the builder click on it and then as mentioned we simply check once per day at 105 then we add the next block running in session drag and drop connect it click on the block and here we want to simply run the system between 105 so that's a little bit of a redundancy but we just add it here again for the sake of consistency until 10 pm now you open here the advanced options and there you can actually add when you want to trade this system per month so you want to for example maybe exclude any month we don't want to do this here for this system or you want to simply include specific days so here we only want to trade on amonday so what we do we only do the check mark on monday then we go to the trading rules section this block is the superstar of most trading systems because there you pretty much define very often the core logic of your trading system and what are we defining here we simply define friday close below the moving average now of course you also have to define this in the block itself so here on the left hand side you choose candle candle close based on the candle id number one then you go to the time frame we do this on the daily time frame so you scroll down click on daily then the candle close must be smaller than the moving average period 40 and here we define it as the exponential moving average close price and here we also define the time frame on the daily candle number one and that's it for this block then the next again trading rule if this condition is true so we connect it with the'd with the green connector and we simply want to check was there a bearish close so we'll just add this note so i know later on what this block is doing so i don't need to always open up the block here it's simply checking a candle value against another candle value so what we need to do we open here the drop down menu click on candle the candle close with the candle id number one of the daily again this is pretty much the default we want to have here in every single block really make sure that you always when you build your own systems are being consistent then you again check this against another candle value actually of the same candle candle id number one but here the candle open again of the daily time frame so we simply scroll down here click on daily and now what is the logic candle open of the last candle id so we do this on the monday right so the last candle id but let me repeat this so we are triggering the system only on the monday so candle id 1 is the last fully closed candle since it's forex we are not trading during the weekend so not sunday and saturday so candle id number one is here friday so we simply check is it a bearish candle because if the candle close is smaller than the candle open it's a bearish candle then we simply want to make sure that we don't have any trades open so we go here to trading management click on count trades drag and drop it connect it with this and we simply want to make sure that the trade count is indeed zero for buys only we go only go long in the system and now comes the juicy part when all of these conditions are true we now open the trading execution section and we only go long in this system we drag and drop the buy now block and now you already see open up quite some settings here on the right hand side the money management right now is simply set on a fixed volume in the system i will share with you but you can also definitely play around i heavily suggest it to you to change it to risk percentage of balance so the risk sizing adjust's to your complete account size so you not always take one lot but which can be quite a lot for a small account so you definitely want to maybe take a view on this setting but i will keep it right now simple at one lot for every single trade now we go over to the stop loss and take profit section as i mentioned it before we actually don't have a stop loss and no take profit usually this is not a best practice and not suggested however what we're doing here and this is also why it doesn't make sense here in this area to add a percentage why because you always need a stop loss to have a worst case scenario implemented in your system so you always know when price is hitting this stop loss this price level i maximum lose 50 100 if you don't have a stop loss this setting risk percentage of balance doesn't really make sense same for fixed amount of money so here if you keep also the stop loss take profit and take profit level as is you also need to figure out a viable amount for the lot size so we're talking here about the us 30 and this is the back test report you can also fetch yourself well either back testing the system yourself or you simply get the file in the help center article which is again attached down below in the video description and then you see the outcome of that trading system based on one lot and then you get also a feeling of the behavior of that system so here we tested it from 2020 until 202 5 until mid september on uh 100k account with a leverage of 1 to 100 now let's assume you don't have such a big account right let's say you want to maybe test it on demo money but then if it's demo money you can simply also have a little bit fun and go with 100k or you want to trade your own money let's say you start with 1k so you divide it simply by 100 so also the results here are roughly then divided by 100 then the numbers you can be curious about is the average winner and loser and the biggest winner and loser so here the biggest winner during this back test from 2020 until 202 5 has been roughly 1 500 the biggest loser has been roughly 1k 94 2 the average winner sits at 520 and the average loser at 32 1 now when you divide it by roughly 100 so you trade it with a onek account i think the numbers also for beginners are getting much more comfortable by on average winning 5 and losing 3 with this system and this is fine because your win rate sits at 57 compare this with that the winner the average winner is bigger than the average loser it's a profitable system on this asset on the us 30 just a little excursion about the stop loss and take profit levels let's quickly go back because now we still need to define when to close all the trades so here we open the auto close trade section we make it based on a relative time so here we will close after 1 day so 24 hours plus 21 hours plus 50 minutes just for the sake of fun plus 2 seconds so the trade that has been taken in this system will be closed on a tuesday evening after being open for 21 hours 50 minutes and 2 seconds so roughly during the tuesday evening pretty much so this logic will be the same for all four assets which are the's p 500 german 40 us 100 and us 30 once again for details check out the help center article",

    "text": "welcome to Profectus AI the no ode platform for building trading bots on MetaTrader 5 this video is part of a portfolio we discovered on youtube inspired by trader renee balk you'll find the full portfolio breakdown and its article linked below of course keep in mind past performance is not a promise of future returns what you'll learn here is not just how to access and install this specific bot but also how to build a system like this step by step understanding the logic the building blocks and all the nitty-gritties so you can apply them to your own strategies as well and if you haven't done so already i invite you to like and sub scribe to stay tuned for upcoming videos it is free for you meaning the world for us and now let's continue with the video the range breakout on us dollar japanese yen it's a pro version in a nuts hell it is simply checking the range between 3 00 am and 4 30 so this line is marking 3 00 am this one 4 30 the system would be looking at this range looking on the very high and the very low so let's quickly mark this so this is the highest point this one was the lowest then what the system is doing it is simply placing pending orders on the high and on the low here in that case it's clearly breaking out to the downs ide so it takes a short position right here the stop loss is being placed the other side where the pending order has been now we enter here so here this pending order is deleted but the stop loss is now of that trade we don't have a take profit but in this case we actually have a stop loss and the trade will be closed at roughly 7 00 pm in the evening 6 55 where is that let's take this lines 6 55 that would be right here so the candle close would be somewhere here so this would be the complete trade you see it was also almost hitting our stop loss actually and the trade will be closed here based on time with a risk to reward ratio of 2 8 now what the system is also doing is it's checking the range it has to have minimum size right it doesn't make sense like this one if it's too small cu z price wasn't moving enough so there has to be minimum range and it also doesn't make sense to have amassive range right for example when this would be the range would be relatively big so until one of these like price levels like here the high and here the low is would be hit it might be already super late in the day right and then you don't have so much time anymore that the trade develops etc so there's also in the trading system which i will go through in a sec also maximum range defined as well and also nice about this system is there's only one trade per day max and now let's build it from scratch since the system is a little bit more complex we are working with variables and inputs very short explanation variables is simply a value that the system is working with and it's changing over time so here we are for example storing the price level or we are also simply using them as gateway's to here for example this variable tr ada ble we call it switch it into a one and one means cool it's now active and then later on we switch it back to a zero so to mark it as it's turned off this is the use cases for variables inputs are pretty much the settings you once can set for the trading board so here you see you can define max range and min range if you want to play around with this kind of input to make it less sensitive to range so maybe you are comfortable or you want to test and back test this system on a bigger range or even smaller ranges here we also have max spread for the entrance then we also have pre de fine'd start times for the range 3 00 am the end range time 4 30 right what we just saw before on the screen and we only allow the trading system to trade from 4 31 so 1 minute after the detection of the range until 6 55 in the evening at 65 5 with these settings the open trade will be closed and here risk we define it as 1 it will be 1 of your balance and step number one in the system is that we will define the range so here we run at time can also close this one and here we select start trading or actually we can keep it open so you also see what we tr a what we are talking about we can close the variables for now start trading at 43 1 then the next block is a variable block in particular the formula block which is a pro block we connect it and in this block we will calculate the range which i've just discussed before right so here we take the variable range width so it's a variable and here now we work with market properties because now we want to check the highest price and the lowest price what is logic right we want to see what was the highest price and the lowest price in this time period so we start here with the highest price based on time period we also have candle period but here we use time period here we define the start time here the end time so simply collect here the start range which is an input and the end range which is also an input day offset we keep it at zero and what do we want to get we want to get the price value the time frame we keep on current you will simply apply the trading bot on the 5 min ut charts so it will be fine now on the right hand side actually we want to change it to minus change this one also to amarket property we have now here the highest price level and now we want to check what is the lowest price level on the server time again so here same stuff start range end range we want to get the price value and that's it now we're going to work with this new variable which is defined the range width so quickly going back to our example what we did here pretty much with the range width we defined this value so it's not a price li fraction so here would be like seven pip's the range we're talking about now we go back we click here on add new formula cu z now we want to make sure that our width range width we just calculated does have a certain size so here we take the range percent defined so here we click value defined as the range width divided by the candle clause defined by candle clause id number one that's it for that block now the next one is again the infamous trade rule block connected here you simply want to check is the minimum range size given so again open up the inputs and variables so you know what we are talking about here and here we're simply comparing one value against another value we simply want to make sure that the range percent is bigger or equal to the minimum range so here we defined it in our inputs with 0 02 or in other words 0 2 cool now let's copy paste this one we connect it we change this word ing to maximum range width what needs to change range percent stays the same but now this one needs to be smaller or same size as the max range and if this condition is true we want to define variables so we take the modify variable block from the variable section connect it with the green connector and here as i mentioned before we use now the tr ada ble range variable which we will now change to a one so pretty much we say we tell our system that we will build here on the right hand side cool green light we're good to go trading this detected range so this is pretty much just the calculation part and now we come to the juicy part where we run this trading bot per session what does it mean again we start with a when to trade block as so often and in particular run in session let's do it like this and we will simply add our inputs start trading and end trading just quick reminder start trading and trading 4 31 6 55 in the evening and uh i will now first build the buy side of this system and the first block is kind of maybe hard to understand but you will get it because the very last block is defining the variable which is being checked in this block we simply make sure hey is there a buy trade if no buy trade fantastic because we really want to only take one trade per session this is pretty much the purpose of this block what we do here we compare a value that we define later on and we use here the variable by trade if this one is zero you will see at the very end like we will build the decision tree out and if all those conditions are true and a in this case by now is happening at the very end this block will come and i will quickly build it so you already get an understanding of why we are adding this block cu z here the buy trade variable will be set to one and then this condition is not true anymore because by trade is one and it's not zero anymore so this this connection would be triggered but it's not connected to anything we will do the same as well already just i don't forget it later on for the sell side so sell trade also this variable will be defined as one so this block will be on the on the other side let me actually quickly do that so you already understand what i mean so this is just the beginning of the decision tree for the sell side but here instead of the buy trade we simply add the variable for the sell trade cool now let's go back to the uh buy side decision tree so if this condition is true the next trade rule block will be checked which is this one and we will simply see is the range valid how are we doing this we defined a variable right which is called tr ada ble range and if this one is defined as one we go ahead where did this variable pop up tr ada ble range here in the very first decision tree we built trade able range one if all those conditions are true that we just created before then again next trade rule block so if the condition is true connected with a green connector we want to see is a range breakout happening range breakout what are we doing here we are falling back on the market property and here we simply keep it on the ask price so what is happening here with this setting here we simply get the value of the current ask price and now we want to see is this ask price crossing over this what this means with the size of one pip over the market property which we are now defining here which is the highest price makes sense because now we're checking here the buy side and now we're checking is the price breaking out to the upside we make it based on time period again as we know it start range and the end range day offset nope still at zero and here what to get we want to get the price value time frame you also keep it standard on the current time frame you simply need to pay attention when you apply the trading bot which needs to be on the 5'm minute time frame cool now the next block is the countries which you find on the under trading management we drag and drop it so if this condition is true click on it we simply want to make sure yep no trades are open yet again taking into consideration that we really only want to take one trade at a time and one trade per session so here we simply already change it to buys or sells doesn't really matter that much then you already know that we are also checking the spread so here under trading rules check spread drag and drop connected and here we want to make sure that the current spread is smaller than the maximum spread as we defined it quick call back spread 10 so this is the max spread we allowed in our system and now we are almost at the modify variable block but what is missing it's missing the buy now block so now you already see that there's a little differentiation of my initial explanation of the system instead of placing pending orders we simply take a trade instantly when those conditions are true thanks to the market properties we have defined before so this is just a small uh addition to my prior explanation so you're not confused or whatever and here now we define first of all the money management very important here you see it's by default on 1 but here we will change it with risk that we defined before so you click on it then the stop loss is for the buy trade position pretty much the entrance point of the short right so we simply need to now fetch again the lowest price of the time range we have defined before so here we want to fetch the custom price level based on the market property on the lowest price based on the time period again start range same story every day end range and we want to get the price value the take profit we don't have it no take pro fi't but now we again add an auto close based on fixed time which is defined on end trading so here quick call back 65 5 in the evening if this then the trade has been taken we connect the modify variable block so now you see what's happening the buy trade variable and the sell trade variable is getting changed to one so here this one is now one and it doesn't equal zero anymore so that's why this connection is not triggered anymore but this one but it's not connected to anything same to this one where we'll we'll just build the decision tree in a second so here by having this modify variable block and this kind of like gateway you're simply making sure that not any further trades are being taken all right now let me quickly wrap up also the short side of this trading system here we pretty much do the same stuff so i can copy paste some parts of it we again check is the range tr ada ble if yes fantastic now here the change is of course now you want to check the breakout to the downs ide so you want to see is the price crossing from the upside to the downs ide with one pip size and here we simply check the low's price based on time period start range we want to get the price value so here everything stays the same also count traits we simply can copy paste this block pull it over also the check spread block remains the same can pull it over and now we take the shell no block which again is defined by our risk input the stop loss is again custom price level based on market property based on the highest price based on time period start range end range you know the drill getting the price value take profit again no take profit and the auto close is happening at a fixed time at end trading cool so in in that case if a sell trade has been taken again we block the two decision trees to be triggered again for the day so we only take if the cell block is being triggered only one trade a day so the only part which is now missing is at the end of our trading session so at 6 55 in the evening we want to reset all our variables to start fresh in the next day so here we take the run at time block change it to the end trading input and add a very important block which is the modify variable block we connect it and here we pretty much define that our uh buy trade variable is being reset ted to zero at new variable that our sell trade variable is being reset ed to zero that our range width variable is reset ed to zero that our range percent is being reset ed to zero and that also our very important tr ada ble range variable is being reset ted to zero so now this is the complete system",

    "text": "welcome to Profectus AI the no ode platform for building trading bots on MetaTrader 5 in this video we'll take a fast walk th rou gh of the turn around tuesday expert adviser how it works how to test it and how you can adjust it to fit your own trading style this strategy is part of a six bot portfolio inspired by trader renee balk and you'll find the full portfolio overview and article linked below as always remember past performance is not a promise of future returns what you'll learn here is how to understand the core logic of the bot explore its key settings and see step by step how to modify or rebuild it directly inside Profectus AI ai so you can make it your very own trading system fast walk th rou gh of the turn around tuesday expert advisor i'll show you how it works the settings and how you should test it so it fits your style and also how to adjust it how to make it your very own trading bot within Profectus AI first of all the demo we are seeing here running in the background the idea of this trading bot is stupid ly simple and that is also why it works we simply watch moving average i run it on a 40 period daily moving average so when price stays above the moving average the ea does absolutely nothing when the price actually drops below the moving average trades appear so every trade opens on amonday and it is closed the latest on a tuesday evening so that is the turn around tuesday the so the big indices sometimes're tra ce after the weekend they dip below the moving average of monday and then they bounce back on monday into tuesday so if you believe that pattern still shows up this strategy might be for you now let's get into the more practical stuff regarding the take profit and stop loss they work in very very simple manners there are no stop losses there are no take pro fi ts the only management style of this very straightforward trading bot is simply closing all the trades after x amount and now actually let's make it a practical example in the builder of pr ac us ai here we see the turn around tuesday trading bot in its full glory only consisting out of six blocks in its pure st form and we see here i will simply quickly walk you through the skeleton of this trading bot and then explain you how to get it yourself to run it on MetaTrader so first of all block number one simply defines let's allow this trading bot to only run starting from 1 00 am or actually 10 5 to be precise and we only allow this training bot to run between 10 05 until 10 pm in the evening and to only kick off the next block on amonday as well so if those conditions are true we are within this time frame and we are amonday today this connection is being triggered because condition is true here nothing is connected that's why redundant so now the next block is a trade rule block simple rule is that the last candle close so the last day had to be lower than the exponential moving average with the period of 40 the exponential part is defined here under the moving average method the time frame is also defined here we made it fixed on daily and there's also the beauty when you later on want to test variables uh and inputs you can add here inputs as well so you can actually switch the time frame very convenient ly within MetaTrader but this is a pro function on professors that's why you don't need it if it's your very first trading bot now if this condition is true the next block will be triggered with this connection we see here bearish candle or in more technical terms no we're looking for bearish candles so what does it mean the candle close needs to be lower than its candle open then it's a red candle we see on the charts if it's a red candle aka bearish candle the next block is being triggered with this connection so no trades open so it is defined simply checks do we have any trades open yes or no so here we check cool there are no trades open it still sits at zero so we are good to go to open a new buy position this block is simply ensuring us that we don't open hundreds of trades per day we simply open one trade at a time and that is it now we go to the juicy part the buy now block you see already this trading system is only going long so here the money management so far is set to one a lot based uh yeah based on this simply set at one by default you definitely want to switch this uh probably to for example risk percentage of balance so when you have a 10k trading account you set it here still at 1 in that case you only risk 100 for your trading account so this is pretty neat stuff because then you always take risk according to your funding balance pretty much now as i already mentioned before there is no stop loss no take profit yet so absolutely no management is happening but now when we go to the auto close trade section we see here it's based on relative time what does it mean as soon as we open actually a trade a timer starts within the trading bot it simply starts counting for 1 day 21 hours 50 minutes and 2 seconds the 2 seconds are very crucial of course of course uh obviously joking here but uh what does it mean after this time so roughly almost 2 days we close the trade the latest and this is the whole magic of the turn around tuesday trading bot now let's assume you don't want to change anything but if you want to do so you can definitely can do that for example in the template section you can add trailing stop to already become a little bit more sophisticated simply click here on apply template and then the template will be applied on your charts so you don't actually need like a an idea from the get go how to use Profectus AI after a while you definitely get a feeling for it and then you can also dive into the blog sections for that i definitely recommend you to check out our help center articles on prof ctors it is structured just like an online course and we currently cover level one and level two very easily in this video so simply stick to it so you already get a rocket start your shell on this via this youtube channel so what we do now we keep everything as is we click here in the upper right corner on x 5 we export the file then we open up the folder where you saved it you simply copy it and then you open MetaTrader 5 this is pretty much the requirement already in this video if you are not sure yet simply check out the video here in the upper right corner where you we explain the whole process in how to get MetaTrader 5 let's assume you already have it so you copy this file that you have just downloaded on your laptop and you simply click here in the upper left corner on file then on open data folder you double click on'm q l 5 you double click on experts then you see i already created this folder and you simply copy paste the file now in this folder you can close the window then you have to open the navigator if it's not open yet you click on view click on navigator so the window pops up then we have to scroll down a bit until we see expert advisor we right click on it click ref resh then the trading bot will pop up in your strategy test er window if this window is also not open yet you again click on view click on strategy test er and then you will see it here in the list where you saved it turn around tuesday then the last step you need it to let it run on the german index de 40 so you click here on the golden dollar sign and then you simply see all the assets provided by your broker you type in de 40 as i already did but incorrect and then you simply double click so it becomes golden the symbol you click okay and then it will also pop up here under your symbols and then you're ready to go to visually back test this trading bot yourself to get a feeling for it and what you do from here pretty much is first of all getting an idea a feeling of what what this trading bot is doing the trading rational that i already explained very very important and you can't skip this part if you feel comfortable in the mechanics of this trading bot it is time to forward test it so still on demo money but now you actually apply the trading bot on your charts how you do it you simply open up the actual chart uh on MetaTrader 5 of de 40 in that case you click on the folder expert advisor you scroll down until your folder appears the trading bot i click here here i see cool pi turn around tuesday and what i simply do i drag and drop it onto the chart you click here allow trading you say it's okay i won't do it yet right here well actually i can do it yeah why not click you see it's now applied we change it to the branding of pr ac us ai then if this little hat is not blue yet you might need to click here on al go trading so you see now it's red and also here it's getting gray if it's gray simply need to click here on al go trading so this is the whole magic of how to get your first trading bot or add a new trading bot to your overall portfolio how to adjust it within Profectus AI how to download it from Profectus AI and how to get it into MetaTrader 5 i hope you enjoyed it i see you in the next one cheers and goodbye",

    "text": "let's create a profitable strategy together log in to Profectus AI and get started let's go to template's where strategies are pre built for us here you can see five trading strategies and five management styles as a begin ner let's focus on the strategies first select the inside bar breakout strategy this is a trading strategy for gold on the daily time frame click apply template great and then click on ex 5 export i have uploaded the exported file into MetaTrader 5 if you don't have MetaTrader 5 please watch that tutor ial first let's run a back test for this strategy i drag and drop the algorithm i select the gold symbol and daily time frame i select visual mode to see the charts this is the strategy in action let's build it in Profectus AI from scratch so we can learn to create a trading strategy first we need to understand the logic this strategy uses the inside bar pattern this is how that pattern works you have two candles tick's candle one which is the most recently closed candle and candle two which is the candle before candle one we call this candle id one and candle id two the inside bar pattern happens when candle one high is lower than candle two high and at the same time the candle one low is higher than the candle two low here you clearly see that candle id 2 is higher and lower than candle id 1 confirming the inside bar pattern in Profectus AI ai we create this with two trade rule blocks in block one we confirm that candle high two is higher than candle high one in block two we confirm that candle low 2 is lower than candle low one all right now we know the trading rules let's walk through the whole strategy together we want this algorithm to run at 2 at night we want to check if it is tuesday wednesday thursday or friday then the inside bar logic is checked then we check if we don't have more than five trades open at this time then we place a buy pending order the order is placed at the candle high of candle 1 this is the inside bar remember we use a stop loss of half a of the current price we use a target of five times the stop loss size this is called a risk to reward of 1 to 5 at the same time we also place a sell pending order but then at the low of the inside bar the stop loss and target placement is similar to the buy pending order we also have the same tree for monday we had to split this and change the candle id logic because we have the weekend in between friday and monday sometimes a broker has sunday candles tick's so this was the right way to solve that problem then we want to add trade management we use four blocks for this select trades check profit once per trade modify the stop loss or target go ahead and study how this works by opening the blocks thank you for watching make sure to like sub scribe and comment your questions",

    "text": "why care for price action price action trading cuts through the noise by concentrating on the market's most fundamental element price price action is the most powerful tool in trading but most traders still traded manually he sit ating doubt ing them sel and missing move therefore let me give you a very quick crash course about candles tick's and price action patterns before we dive into the nitty-gritties of each price action let's take a look here at this chart we're looking on the daily time frame of gold traded against the us dollar if you're not familiar with candles tick's you're probably familiar with the line chart you see on the news they are telling you one single information which is usually the closing price of that day so this is just one point of information for example here on the 18th of august 202 5 the gold price closed around 3 333 us this is the one information you get however now we want to talk about candles tick's let's change it to candles tick's again and by just looking on the one candles tick such as this one you do not only get the one information the closing price you get three more information's on top for the sake of simplicity let's solid ly look on those two candles this red one and this green one so there are two main types of candles tick's one is a bearish candle which is for example this one the red one which is simply telling you that the value of the underlying asset decreased in value during the day and the green one is simply telling you that the value of the underlying asset increased during the day so this part is really important so let me it erate on what this means in reality i will now draw the exemplary price development of this candle we looking here on the bearish candle so you get an idea why the beginning of this body is marking the opening the close the highest high and the lowest price level so here on the 13th of july 202 5 the price opened at this price level it's somewhere developed during the day here to this price level marking the highest value for the day then later on price developed somewhere here which is marking the lowest low the lowest value for the day and then the price the candle closed somewhere in this period so when you hear this the very first time it might be a bit confusing and maybe overwhelming i will give you another example now with a bull ish candle to really make sure that we are nail ing this part because it is so crucial so important not only for algorithm ic traders but also for manual traders to truly understand the mechanics behind candles tick's for being able to comfortably playing around with price action patterns now for this bull ish candle the day opened on this price level at some point moved down here moved up and you see actually almost the close price equals the highest high so it's a very strong candle to the upside it moved a tiny little bit here down below but marginal ly so you see this tiny little line which is like marking highest high is pretty much equals the close price let me quickly make it visible so here the candle opened at this price level the lowest low was reached here we see the highest price point was somewhere here so very very close to the closing price and the actual closing price is right there another important terminology is as well that we are also talking about in this video is the total candle size that is simply meaning from the upper highest price so the top wi ck upper wi ck down below to the lower wi ck this is pretty much marking the complete size of this candle so here talking about the total candle size then there's another terminology where we only talking about the total body candle size so this is only the size of the body of the candle and another terminology is the size of the wi cks so that would be here the size of the upper wi ck of that candle which is very very tiny i must admit it and also plus the wi ck size of the lower one why is this important because we very much care about the ratio of a body to wi ck so this candle we are looking here right now the bull ish one is a prime example for a strong candle because the price was very determined moving into one direction here up and the flu ct uation to the downs ide as well as to the upside was very minimal so here the body is when i'm eye ball ing it taking up roughly 85 90 of the complete candle size which is for us an indication for a strong move and then just keeping this number in mind 90 or 80 size of the body compared to the total candle size is marking for us a strong candle so price is moving with force this information we can later use in algorithm ic trading as well to detect these kind of candles as a potential entry point one example of the other extreme is when the wi ck size is actually so much bigger than the body size right now i'm just marking the size of the wi ck you see here this bearish candle indeed we'll make it a little bit bigger is very very small the price opened here it closed here but in the meanwhile price moved in extreme to this price level and also at one point of time to this price level so there was no clear direction in the market in within this candles tick of the price moving in a certain direction with force so here again eye ball ing it the body compared to the wi ck size is maybe taking up 5 rather less even if right so this information you can use again to also then detect so called im balance candles where the body this is the body is in minority to the wi ck size very last terminology but as important as all the other ones are candle id's this is the last one and then we get into the price action pattern when we talking about candle id's it's pretty much the id ent ifier of the candle we are talking today i'm recording the video on the 3rd of september 202 5 we do have 10 am 10 24 so this is that candle it's still in development we see that the price opened somewhere at this price level currently it's here so you also see this candle slightly moving right because it is still in development so we are not entirely sure yet where it will close price also might move even further so it might also not be clear yet that this highest high will sustain same as for the lowest low so simple words candle id zero is pretty much just the candle that is in development right now it can be the day it can be the hour it can be the minute now candle id number one is simply said the candle before the candle id zero so today is wednesday so yesterday was tuesday so this is the tuesday candle marked with candle id number one monday candle id number two then no trading is happening on gold on saturday and sunday so candle id number three would be friday thursday and wednesday from last week would have the candle id number five that's it that was the crash course and now let's get into it with the fun",

    "text": "welcome back in this video we're diving into something a little different price action patterns instead of building a full trading botstart to finish we're going through specific components like impulse candles't wee zers inside day breakout's and dog eis these are not complete systems on their own but they're powerful viable building blocks you can use to strengthen your own strategies we'll build each of these patterns step by step inside Profectus AI ai so you'll see exactly how to turn a trading concept into something mechanical and rule based by the end you'll understand the ni tty grit ties of how these patterns work and more importantly how to use them in your own trading bots as always keep in mind past performance is not a promise of future returns and if you want to go deeper the full walk th rou gh's articles and downloads are linked below now let's get into the first pattern the impulse candle and it will then look something like this on your charts these arrows will always mark pretty much the entries based on the system we've just created right so for example here you see very clearly this is an im balance candle huge eng ulf ing candle with strong movement to the downs ide so here we put a red arrow on top same here im balance candle with a small body a lot of wi ck and then an following candle strong movement to the downs ide another example now for the upside here we see pretty much only wi ck almost no body and then a strong movement to the upside again mark with a green arrow so this is pretty much how we imagined first block we need simply run per candle on top we keep it on current then we will need a variable block which we simply need here now is figuring out the the total candle size so we only need to pick it here from the list then here on the left hand side we go for candle and for the parameter candle total size in pip's candle id number two advanced options we keep all as is on the current time frame and then here simply value zero so we simply fetch the candle total size can close that one then what we do next one the trade rule block one of the most used blocks we have on Profectus AI then we simply tag here the value block candle size based on candle size of one adjust by amulti pl ier we have now to still to define so here simple multi ply ing it by x create by now here a new input let's call this input mp l for multi pl ier by default setting this to three so now we can select it here mp l again we close that boy here and then we go back to this block so this one has to be smaller than the candle total size so here again we pick the candle from the list the candle total size in pip's from the candle id number one so one candle before not two candles before we close that one and now it's about checking do we have a so called 50 candle im balance candle as we have learned just before so here we take again the trade rule block connect it like this let's call it the 50 candle now we change both here to candle again candle body size in pip's this time so we only want to really know without the wi cks how big is the candle candle id number one has to be bigger or equal then the candle total size we want to not just say 50 maybe want to also see 70 30 5 right so here we add another constant actually let's do this quickly input and let's call it body size and we make it by default to 0 5 so 50 you see here body size we have it available and now i want to check is the candle i with the candle id number one so the past clause candle a bull ish or a bearish candle how do we do this again we get take a trade rule block connect this one here again we check the candle and here we simply check call candle id 1 is the candle close higher than the candle open quick check when the candle close is higher than the candle open we have a bull ish candle so here i simply use the draw and chart block so if the condition is true this block will be triggered and if this is not true this block will be triggered you simply write here bearish then here we change it to candle id number one let's make it green for bull ish candle and for the bearish one same logic we simply change this to one instead of green we take red and vo ila we already figured out the impulse candle this price action pattern to work out now so now let me put this here on top of it let's call it the im balance plus impulse price action so you know exactly what price action pattern is good for quick introduction to the impulse and im balance price action pattern to simply detect movement in the market into a certain direction in very few words what is it first it consists out of two candles one candle is an im balance candle for example this one is an im balance simply meaning there's a lot of wi ck and a very small body going on like here or like here or this also very good example a lot of wi ck and very small body size and then what we're looking for this is one of the candles the next candle is supposed to be a strong candle with a lot of body and minimal amount of wi ck for example this one the wi ck as we can see is almost non existent of this candle it's a strong movement to the upside and the prior candle actually was an im balance candle with a lot of wi ck this one is a good one so here this candle is a very well im balance'd candle with no clear direction anywhere a lot of wi ck not a lot of body and then a strong movement to the upside with another candle with a lot of body and that is pretty much the whole purpose of this price action pattern now let's get actually into how to auto mate such a price action pattern on prof let's continue with the next price action pattern which is called the't wee zers quick explanation what is the't wee zer i'm here on baby pip's you have usually a top and a bottom't wee zer i will give you a quick explanation of the't wee zer top and then they will be just reversed for the bottom so the't wee zer top is a bearish reversal pattern as we see it right here top of an up tre nd consists of two japanese candles tick's so we always doing with candles tick's with matching tops these are the tops here these are wi cks here we see the body size so pretty much we need at least two candles which are having a kind of a similar top highest high point of time so here the matching tops are usually composed of shadows aka wi cks but can be the candles bodies as well so doesn't need to be these wi cks can be also the body here these ones a't we a top occurs during an up tre nd when buyers push prices higher often ending the session near the highs but were not able to push the top any further quickly to the meaning well it simply shows there's an area of resistance that is interesting for us to know and then you can simply use it at your disposal whenever it makes sense for your trading strategy it's relatively long it's relatively complex these are top as i already mentioned it the right hand side the bottom is on the left hand side and you actually see it's not just indicating it's actually taking a trade this is obviously up to you if you want to trade on this single price action pattern there are definitely circumstances where this could be a viable approach and i will just walk you quickly through this kind of price action pattern building this piece by piece is taking a little bit of time despite its relative simple approach it needs quite some planning so i will walk you through here we start with a formula block which is a pro feature so here we simply define a variable which we define as upper wi ck size so here we take the candle upper wi ck size in pip's dividing it here with the candle total size again also in pip with the candle id one and we are storing it into it in this variable then the next one simply taking the candle upper wi ck size also in pip's divided by the candle total size pretty much the same stuff just for candle id number two so here you already see we are talking about two candles tick's we have no stored right with these thanks to these two formula blocks now you say hey we haven't this now yet in a variable it's indeed an input so you can find this in the input section of this price action pattern simply having an impact or decision up to you also of how big the wi ck size must be to flag this as a viable't wee zer bottom in that case or actually't wee zer top pardon then if this condition is true you do the same stuff also with the candle id number two then you also want to check is the candle closed higher than the candle open if yes cool let's check this also for candle id number one so the one candle has to be bull ish and the other one has to be bearish we also added this trade rule to simply check is the candle high slightly higher with the candle id number one then the candle id with number two so this is something you can also think for yourself do you want to keep this kind of block or do you even want to add more more specific rules to this't wee zer top and bottom kind of price action pattern i think this is just pretty much one of the suggestions how you could define't wee zer top it's a very mechanic approach since mostly especially let's quickly check this on google you see many many pictures and usually they are always a little bit different right especially when you ask one trading guru or someone else on ins tagram or on youtube or on wherever they always in most cases don't really have a specific rule they don't have it recognized as no you have it actually and there you have to be precise how much wig gle room do you want to give that specific price pattern in regards to be valid or being invalid right so here i really suggest you to think it through do you only want to for example define it like here in this picture for instance by very small wi ck size so both candles for either directions reversal's are very strong or are you also okay for example here with having a little bit more wi ck or actually having the majority of the candles tick being a wi ck right so being a little bit more im balance in that case so here you can also really play around and this is also where the beauty and the fun in my point of view really comes in with back testing strategies and building these kind of price action patterns yourself from bottom because then you really understand them and you know exactly why a certain signal has been triggered all right so much to the't wee zer top and bottom inside a breakout inside days breakout however you want to call it you simply want to detect a consolidation of a certain time period and then a breakout of this range let me give you one of many examples i could give let's say we are currently here so we don't have any clue about what is happening right here this is for example the candle in creation this is candle id number two and the very simple inside breakout price pattern is simply checking is the candle high with the candle id number one lower than the candle high with a candle id number two also checking is the candle low of candle id one higher than the low of the candle with a candle id number two so in simple words is this candle inside of the candle before for example this one this candle is completely inside of that candle right you see the low and the high is completely eng ulf ing this candle so this is the kind of price action we are looking for so this is for example not the price action we are looking for they're completely breaking out of each other so here also this one would be a valid one because it's completely engulfed by the prior candle now let's build this bad boy we go here on the left hand side trading rules now actually when to trade run per candle so we stay ag nostic on the candle size we keep it also on current for now and then our evergreen can block actually we will use trade rule let's quickly connect it right here and here we will again solely base it on candle and also here on candle we are looking here on candle id number two here on candle id number one and here we check candle high is it bigger than the candle high with a candle id number one right very straightforward we also keep the time frame on the current one of course when you are on pro you can also simply use the time frame based on input so you can very simply change it within the inputs within MetaTrader 5 what makes back testing so much more convenient and this is already the first block how we will use it now we check the next one tread rule block actually let me del ete this one let me just copy paste that boy and connect it like this because the condition has to be true and let's call this one actually high and now we define the low so we click on it and instead of high we change this one to candle low this one to candle low of course we also need here candle high so now back to the low block candle low two and one yep that's correct and then we also need to change this one to this sign because now the candle low of candle id number two has to be lower than the candle low with the candle id number one for the ones who want to simply place pending orders on those breakout levels because it's a breakout play you could do the following you go here on trading management you click here on del ete orders you need this simply to del ete the prior pending orders that are on the chart to simply avoid you take hundreds of trades right so now your chart is cleaned again from the prior price levels now let's say you also want to make sure that you're not currently still in a trade so let's say this has to be zero for both buys and sells if this is then true you go here buy pending order let's do it like this sell pending order connect them already now let's check it out for the buy pending order the open price level we simply make this based on custom price based on candle right and on the candle low actually i am mistaken on the candle high why because now you are placing the pending order on the candle high so you're assuming or this is the play of this kind of price action pattern that the price will continue into this direction so here simply place it on the high of the candle id one price offset zero money management let's simply put it at 1 it's a best practice we simply teach here and stop loss there you can get really creative but let's say you simply want to place it on the candle low so here custom price level based on candle based on the candle low of the same candle we're talking about candle id number one all right and then the profit you simply say well i want to have a one to two risk to reward so you add here 200 of your stop loss whatever the stop loss will be for the pending just in a reverse logic so here you simply want to open at a custom price candle low of candle id number one price offset also zero money management risk of balance same as the other one stop loss also again custom price level but here you want to place it on the candle high right so here candle high number one and then again one to 2 risk to reward we close it we save it and now you have a full trade trading system only based on a very simple price action pattern obviously it needs't we aking it needs an adjustment with the ideas you have to make this a viable trading system but here you already have a fully functional trading system with a very viable price action pattern often ly used by retail traders to simply detect a breakout you pretty much know how you want to define a breakout to how to place pending order in meaningful manners because maybe you want to really see a consolidation for three four five candles so you have to simply add more of these condition blocks trade rule blocks one after another instead of only those two or you have completely different kind of angles for this kind of price action so much to the inside day breakout play let's go to the next one all right sc h slug as we say in germany the next price action pattern one of the very popular ones which we call dog ee just another consolidation im balance kind of price action here on the video we see the extreme form or the Profectus AI form of a dog ee right with a very or almost non existing body and almost only wi ck pretty much just telling us the open price of the candles tick equals pretty much also the closing price of the candles tick so absolutely pure consolidation price has not moved within this candles tick the time frame at all and this is pretty much what we are now trying as well to completely recognize ai as well so there's zero interpretation of what is a dog ee in your trading system hence let's not lose any time and let's get straight to it so here we again start with run per candle on top based on the current time frame of course you can change this by simply here the drag and drop or also making it a variable or an input so you can easily change it within MetaTrader 5 for greater ease of opt imi zing it we change these fields to candle also this one to candle and here to candle body size based on and here the candle total size what do we mean with the body size let's look at this beautiful yellow candle the yellow part is the body and the white part is the wi ck together the wi ck and the body is the total size of a candle let's simply change the candle id here to one and one as well because it is important that we are looking at a candle that is already fully developed and now we go al to the important part the adjust part you simply click on it you click here on the star so we multi ply it by let's say 0 1 so 10 what does it say the candle total size is not allowed to be any bigger than 10 so the body has to be very very small for that we also have to change this symbol to smaller or equal let's change here the description to do and of course i think what is also very interesting i will make this an input here so let's call this body size by default 0 1 now it pops up here body size and now when we click here on adjust we still see it so that makes it testing within MetaTrader so much more convenient and this is already pretty much how you can define a dog ee and then when you see for example well it's not strict enough it's not nicely how i need it then really look carefully on what you actually need one of the many many examples it of course really depends on your trading system that you are trading is that you can for example also say you only allow a candle body size of smaller than for example the average true range of the same time frame so this can be also something very interesting or you want to simply say the candle has to be smaller than five pip's then you can also change it here within this trade rule block before triggering then the next block whatever it will be now let me get rid of this one because this is the pure st form and then simply for you so you can quickly check it out what it is doing we simply want to show that this one is a doi so this will now be pretty much marked with a white arrow on",

trades one clean logic an inside bar at 2 am we'll break down every block from weekday filters to pending orders and position management so by the end you'll understand the full system and can modify

probably always given so from monday to friday this connection will be triggered this one would have been triggered if it's not a weekday but it's not connected anywhere hence nothing is happening and then we simply check out let's actually pause it right here and zoom in to get a practical example these two blocks is defining an inside bar so now when we check it out here on the right hand side you see the inner mechanics of these blocks on our canvas the first one is checking the candle high of candle id 2 candle high with candle id 1 and also the candle with candle id 2 smaller than candle id with number one now let's put it in practice let's assume that we don't know yet the future and we also ignore this candle we are currently sitting exactly at this candle so it's looking back at candle id 1 so let's say this is a wednesday candle this is tuesday this is monday tuesday is candle id 1 monday is candle id number two and what these blocks very fairly simple defined that the candle high of this candle has to be lower than the candle high of this candle and the candle low of that candle of tuesday has to be higher than the candle low of the monday candle id 2 in that case it was the case so that is why it was placing the pending orders around this area and the system is banking on the outbreak's to the upside or downs ide what we are then checking is do we have more than five open trades or five pending orders placed just to keep the system in check and not expose our trading account to too much risk obviously you can change this by getting access to this trading bot for free down below in the video description the only thing we ask from you is having a chat about your pain points how you structure your trading bot journey how you get your trading bots from how you source your trading bot ideas as well we're curious where you're coming from you get access for completely free then not only to Profectus AI but also to this very viable gold trading bot and also to not give too much juice away right away in this video i will not explain these pending orders in depth for now you can check it out yourself when you get your hands on this execution file and then you can also run it yourself on MetaTrader 5 now when i zoom out just by a little bit you will see we have a similar logic for monday trades there's a specific rational behind it explaining it later on in our article center on the website of Profectus AI you also see on the right hand side that we have management in place so you can use this management or simply also use management that you want to code up yourself or quickly showing you the template's when you are simply lacking ideas for certain management approaches you can also use the ones we have on the left hand side click apply template and then you see it's popping up right here on your canvas or you can code it from scratch go to the block section and then you can also go for block by block drag and dropping and build not only the whole strategy but also your own management style exiting style profits and losses but i think a very nice way to kick it off with pr ac us ai which is completely free by the way is to simply get into the blocks the mechanics of this trading system and simply play around with changing the mechanics of how trades are being taken for example based on the inside bar maybe you want to add your indicator which you can easily do when i drag it a little bit more over to here you see here maybe you want to actually check the indicator of the moving average has to be high of the candle high that's a little bit random but these like things you can really check and you can also code up your own strategy or simply kick it off with this template maybe just to give you one idea what you could actually do what is what i find very interesting and very tempting when we let this system run for a bit this green curve is the un real ized losses and profits and the blue line is the realized losses and profits so you see very stable the equity curve is actually higher so it simply means you have a lot of floating profits because the system simply let winners run it's simply not realizing these kind of winners and then what you can actually try to for instance avoid these kind of steep draw down's to ensure that the system is reeling in profits earlier on than the for instance 1 3 ratio you simply say maybe i want to reel in profits already at 1 1 or 1 2 or maybe there's even some potential for sc ul ping system right and you go very low with reeling in profits you go on lower time frames right now the system is running on the daily time frame which is usually also best practice because these kind of systems are more stable over time than on lower time frames due to fewer noise but these are just the many ideas you can go for and you can actually go for it by just checking out the link down below in the video description to get access to this beautiful trading bot and dip your toes the very first time without coding whatsoever into algorithm ic trading it's really easy you simply download the source file and apply it on MetaTrader 5 i think this is really cool that you don't need to bother with coding you simply need an idea and thanks to Profectus AI you don't even need an idea anymore you can simply start with for instance this gold trading bot or with the many template's we also have here we have a breakout strategy which is a viable approach and the momentum strategy based on great british pound us dollar so there's definitely something for all of you and first of all congratulations i know there's a lot of distraction nowadays particularly on youtube if this is the very first time you are hearing about trading bots or algorithm ic trading Profectus AI is the Profectus AI way to kick off your trading bot journey we provide you not only the educational part of things it's also for completely free so you can actually dip your toe and see if you like it or not",

it yourself you see here quickly going through the rational of this viable gold trading system we are looking here simply at 200 am every day let's check out the left hand side if every week day it's probably always given so from monday to friday this connection will be triggered this one would have been triggered if it's not a weekday but it's not connected anywhere hence nothing is happening and then we simply check out let's actually pause it right here and zoom in to get a practical example these two blocks is defining an inside bar so now when we check it out here on the right hand side you see the inner mechanics of these blocks on our canvas the first one is checking the candle high of candle id 2 candle high with candle id 1 and also the candle with candle id 2 smaller than candle id with number one now let's put it in practice let's assume that we don't know yet the future and we also ignore this candle we are currently sitting exactly at this candle so it's looking back at candle id 1 so let's say this is a wednesday candle this is tuesday this is monday tuesday is candle id 1 monday is candle id number two and what these blocks very fairly simple defined that the candle high of this candle has to be lower than the candle high of this candle and the candle low of that candle of tuesday has to be higher than the candle low of the monday candle id 2 in that case it was the case so that is why it was placing the pending orders around this area and the system is banking on the outbreak's to the upside or downs ide what we are then checking is do we have more than five open trades or five pending orders placed just to keep the system in check and not expose our trading account to too much risk obviously you can change this by getting access to this trading bot for free down below in the video description the only thing we ask from you is having a chat about your pain points how you structure your trading bot journey how you get your trading bots from how you source your trading bot ideas as well we're curious where you're coming from you get access for completely free then not only to Profectus AI but also to this very viable gold trading bot and also to not give too much juice away right away in this video i will not explain these pending orders in depth for now you can check it out yourself when you get your hands on this execution file and then you can also run it yourself on MetaTrader 5 now when i zoom out just by a little bit you will see we have a similar logic for monday trades there's a specific rational behind it explaining it later on in our article center on the website of Profectus AI you also see on the right hand side that we have management in place so you can use this management or simply also use management that you want to code up yourself or quickly showing you the template's when you are simply lacking ideas for certain management approaches you can also use the ones we have on the left hand side click apply template and then you see it's popping up right here on your canvas or you can code it from scratch go to the block section and then you can also go for block by block drag and dropping and build not only the whole strategy but also your own management style exiting style profits and losses but i think a very nice way to kick it off with pr ac us ai which is completely free by the way is to simply get into the blocks the mechanics of this trading system and simply play around with changing the mechanics of how trades are being taken for example based on the inside bar maybe you want to add your indicator which you can easily do when i drag it a little bit more over to here you see here maybe you want to actually check the indicator of the moving average has to be high of the candle high that's a little bit random but these like things you can really check and you can also code up your own strategy or simply kick it off with this template maybe just to give you one idea what you could actually do what is what i find very interesting and very tempting when we let this system run for a bit this green curve is the un real ized losses and profits and the blue line is the realized losses and profits so you see very stable the equity curve is actually higher so it simply means you have a lot of floating profits because the system simply let winners run it's simply not realizing these kind of winners and then what you can actually try to for instance avoid these kind of steep draw down's to ensure that the system is reeling in profits earlier on than the for instance 1 3 ratio you simply say maybe i want to reel in profits already at 1 1 or 1 2 or maybe there's even some potential for sc ul ping system right and you go very low with reeling in profits you go on lower time frames right now the system is running on the daily time frame which is usually also best practice because these kind of systems are more stable over time than on lower time frames due to fewer noise but these are just the many ideas you can go for and you can actually go for it by just checking out the link down below in the video description to get access to this beautiful trading bot and dip your toes the very first time without coding whatsoever into algorithm ic trading it's really easy you simply download the source file and apply it on MetaTrader 5 i think this is really cool that you don't need to bother with coding you simply need an idea and thanks to Profectus AI you don't even need an idea anymore you can simply start with for instance this gold trading bot or with the many template's we also have here we have a breakout strategy which is a viable approach and the momentum strategy based on great british pound us dollar so there's definitely something for all of you and first of all congratulations i know there's a lot of distraction nowadays particularly on youtube if this is the very first time you are hearing about trading bots or algorithm ic trading Profectus AI is the Profectus AI way to kick off your trading bot journey we provide you not only the educational part of things it's also for completely free so you can actually dip your toe and see if you like it or not",

    "text": "all right welcome to the Profectus AI web ina r uh we do this every month it's like a great time for you guys to hop in ask your questions but also i always share a profitable strategy with you which i'm going to do and last month we had a lot of updates on the platform and every month we have more updates come coming so this is like a a great moment for us for me but also yo st and nico are here the other founders to answer your questions get your feedback because normally you cannot really have impact on a software company but we want to base our whole platform just on your feedback right what do you need what do you want to auto mate how can we make your life easier because the mission is sim plify ing automated trading for everyone that's our core mission with Profectus AI and that's what our platform is about so what is Profectus AI ai for the uh people that are new real fast it's the easy to learn drag and drop builder to auto mate any trading strategy allowing everyone to trade the fx crypt o and stock market consistently so theory versus practice you want profitable results but how this is like the question i had because i like working out i studied as well um i sleepmy eight hours every day and also you want to play right you want to live so what you're doing you're working out but still you want to make results you're studying and you still want to make results you're sleeping you cannot always be awake right and you're playing and you should be doing these four things but this means one thing and that is that you cannot watch the charts 247 with the required focus to perform and this is a big issue that i figured out along my journey the past 10 years and yo's was the same and nico had the same things and we just figured out that like how to solve these things can you still perform as a trader in the markets or do you is it just not possible if you have a busy life right some of you guys here are entrepreneurs have your own business so maybe you have a little bit more room in your routine to watch the charts but many of us um also just have a job and want to save and invest and trade alongside that right so this is a big thing you cannot watch the charts and perform that's why you miss your trades and have negative long term results so what i'm going to do is share one of my profitable strategies a track record and that's fully automated and then that is this one right so you have a track record here this started in 2021 in october so exactly four years now and i made a total return of 115 so if you trade this strategy with risk or with less risk then of course you have more returns or less returns but this fully automated strategy if you miss trades that has a huge impact on your trading and that's the biggest problem you have to overcome as a trader maybe you don't know that yet but i'm going to show you the impact right now so remember this 115 return right what happens if i only trade 9 to 5 and never missed a trade so imagine i'm here on the trading floor i have nothing else to do than just focused and watching the charts and i never miss a trade so i'm trading 9 to 5 what happens if i take this strategy and trade it like that so i only open my trades between those periods so it's not automated well before i had 115 returns but now after that i only have 69 of returns so by just not trading all the sessions you can see my returns are like half and that's a big impact in your trading and i'm a profitable trader so imagine that you are still learning and trading what a lot of people are doing and they are around that break even mark right and they want to break through to the profitable trading uh mark well they will not reach it because they lose money even though they're break even and this is proof of that and this really brings it home hopefully so this is an old picture of myself running uh to on amountain with a boulder and this is how i started 10 years ago with trading it was like okay i have to study this skill and it was the trading skill we all have been through it right if you already started with trading or investing and it takes you about 6 months or a year to really master trading strategy if the support and resistance supply and demand uh whatever the strategy is ict sm c you have so many names nowadays whatever strategy it is it takes you a few months maybe a year to really master it and then you mastered it and then you realize okay i'm just missing trades i don't take every opportunity or i'm going to make mistakes i'm trading based on emotions and then you're this person running on the mountain just like i was and then you all make amistake and a boulder rolls over you and you start over or you learn a strategy and it takes you a year and then the strategy stops working then you put in all that extra work all that work of studying it and then the markets changed and then yeah you have nothing so i love the markets and i will always love the markets and my passion for the markets is huge and therefore i channel ed that passion towards not just trading but to really learning a skill that even though a strategy stops working you can still use it you can still use that skill and build new strategies so if you want to succeed trade smarter and live free r algorithms catch all market opportunities so you solve that missed trades right trade with confidence so sometimes like news is coming in this afternoon i have some positions opened and my algorithms will manage those trades i will not be influenced by the news i will not make mistakes it will just the trailing stop loss will work of that strategy and all these things just happen automatically so i cannot even make mistakes right and they always trade with confidence like we all know you're doing a prop firm challenge or something you hit a little bit of draw down then you're thinking like do i do i lose this account or not you and you're going to start taking weird trades or doing weird stuff that's all solved with automation and all the strategies are tested over many years just not one year of data but many many years because your computer tests for you while you sleep your computer will find the best settings and back test for you so algorithms can easily double your returns with ease or even triple them or even move you from break even to a profitable trader because yeah manually it didn't work out so Profectus AI ai is built to help you build these algorithms without having to code because i personally and yo ast as well the two of us we moved from manual trading to automation and nico um went straight in uh into learning algorithms because that was just it made more sense right so the biggest obstacle for yo's and i was okay we want to auto mate but we cannot auto mate and i just had a conversation here as well with someone about okay is it really possible to do and i'm going to show you that it is possible to auto mate any strategy you imagine without having to code so how to get started for free it's of course a skill you have to learn um pro active ai is not an educational company it's just a software company um and therefore you need to learn somewhere so the easiest thing is to just find free tutor ials on youtube there are many and more and more people learn this skill get results with the skill and will make content about it so youtube content will grow on how to build on Profectus AI ai that's the quick tip you can already follow there are already some videos but we also have a help center so like i said we are not an educational company but we do uh use your feedback and a lot of you guys are giving us feedback how can i learn quicker right so nico is building this help center and you can find it with doc's profession Profectus AI ai and here you have a lot of tutor ials already to just help help you get started and then you learn the basics and then you can just build and build and you can build easy strategies and then more complex strategies and then the third thing is find free strategies in the platform the latest update we did at the start of september end of august we updated our template section you can see we have now five different trading strategies three strategies are for fx uh one is for crypt o and one is for the's p 500 today i'm sharing a strategy for the ducks uh but you can also trade it on an on's p 500 for instance and test it on whatever you want but we have a lot of free strategies and on top we also have a hidden template library which you can also find and we even have more strategies you can use there so my tip if you're new to this start with those strategies see how they work test them just just two clicks it's apply template and export and you uh run it in MetaTrader right so these are the three biggest tips i help have for you on how to get started for free so let's build a strategy i always uh watch what's happening in industry and one of the strategies i did see was a five minute fair value gap uh opening range breakout strategy a very common uh channel online posted this strategy and we automated this strategy normally if you have to code it it will take you weeks to do it we did it in less than an hour with just dragging and dropping the dropping the blocks on prof act us and we got these results so you can see 117 return and i'm going to talk about this strategy so the trading plan you can screens hot this uh of course this is just for you but i'm going to share a link with you where you uh very soon where you can just download this and test it for yourself so the trading plan it was like a video of 10 20 minutes uh i just watched the video and put it in five different steps the first thing you do is you trade ducks on five minute mark the high at 16 30 1645 and you're trading that opening right you want to wait for the first breakout and that's that's step two the five minute breakout between 1645 and 16 uh uh 1800 yeah so a very short period of time you're looking for a breakout then you want to find the fair value gap if you don't know what that means you can easily find it online but uh i will also show you and trade examples soon and then you need a bull ish formation so we only trade long because yeah the ducks is just the best tr ada ble long only that's also what we do with the's p 500 over time if you look back 100 years the's p al always rises right long term it's a nice edge to have just trade long's only and then enter after a fair value gap is rejected with an eng ulf ing and then a risk to reward of one to five so you risk one and you earn five and then stop loss at the swing low this is the overall trading plan any questions so far guys before i continue uh how do you determine swing low by amount of bars exactly yeah you look back a few candles tick's uh and then you place it at the lowest low so this is a trade example uh here here you see MetaTrader in our uh with a prof act us ai algorithm on it the algorithm that i will share with you and here you can see the buy was executed and then the stop loss is above the buy so that means price already moved in profits and we have automatically uh a stop loss trail because that works very well and then we have a five to one or one to five risk to reward you cannot see the target here but you will soon see it and then you see here the trade played out so you bank ed five r this is the setup and i want to show you right now how it looks in action on the charts look this was the setup i showed you so this is the algorithm in action you have here the buy setup the stop loss is already trailed and then price is just continuing and here you bank so this is fully automated and you can do this yourself as well i will show you how to export it on the platform soon let's see if you can get another trade just to see it in action some trades go very quick and that's a big thing that proves that you cannot trade look at this it happens real quick and it tri the stop loss this happens in it's like a five minute chart so you need to be very focused to do this manually right so if you miss this trade let's say you miss it you miss out of five r and five r that's 5 that might be your monthly return right and that's the big the big problem i want to solve for you guys and we want to solve with Profectus AI ai is sim plify ing your manual trading plan this is just one strategy i've automated thousands of strategies myself yo did as well nico in our uh community people make so many strategies so don't be too focused on just this strategy but more about id like okay i trade this way is it possible to auto mate and it is how does it look in pro active's well if i zoom in like this you can see this is quite an advanced build it is quite big so all you have to do is to click on the link i'm about to share in the disco rd for you and then this opens up if you're not signed in you quickly need to sign in but then this opens up and then you have a big export but button here uh for'm q l 5 or x 5 and if you click on that um and you have an account then you will get the strategy this is a pro strategy but we also have uh other strategies on the platform but let me quickly share the link it will be in your disco rd very soon i always uh keep it there for a few minutes so make sure you take it quickly because this only for people that are live with us right you're sharing it yo's will share it any questions so far guys it is shared cool i want to dive into the platform now with you and show you in action you'll be removed after the web ina r all right this is the platform this is the code and focus on this right now you'll have time to to grab the link here you have um the overall system if you're totally new this might be overwhelming the only important thing here is the buy now button and you can change the stop loss right here if you want um target and a stop loss you can change always in the buy now blocks and if you feel like okay i want an other strategy you can just shift select del ete and then here you have the breakout strategy so this is a pound yen uh on a one hour time frame that's where you execute it here you can read about the strategy you click on apply template and there you have it right if you then export you have this strategy and you can test it for yourself all these strategies are good you can improve them even more and then you have already something to play around with and to trade with because these are tested we test them also uh on years of data and just with your own creativity you can maybe go to a buy now blog go to the stop loss maybe change the stop loss to fixed pip's let's say every trade i want with 50 pip's stop loss and maybe a one to five risk to reward and then you have that right that is how this platform works and then you export it here but maybe you don't want this strategy and you're more like i only trade crypt o okay then you trade crypt o you have a bit co in strategy here time frame 8 hour or 4 hour and then you just apply it you have the blocks here so this is run per candle this is the trading rule and you can just study this on your own but you can also here on the question mark click there and you can go search for help and then you have here level one level two level three level four and you can just ask your questions also with messages and we use nico and i right now just reply to it and answer them ourselves to help you out yeah so i hope this makes it very clear for the more advanced builders you of course have here a lot of things so i want to answer some some of your uh questions now so let me stop sharing and let's dive into the questions if you have any i received a lot also on'd'm so i do have a few i want to answer and the first one was how to change your stop loss and target well i just showed you that in a buy sell blocks you can do that um and then you export the strategy and you're good to go other question was can you get funded or um how does funding work with these uh with these strategies so what i uh did this week i passed already two ft mo challenges with automation so yeah prop firms do allow it but what we want to do and make a difference in this industry is to also fund you guys if you build a good algorithms um that we uh yeah you contact us because we don't know so you contact us like i've been building this i have a track record do you want to invest in us and we're going to do that we're going to do that with a partnership with darwin ex and next week i will hop on a call with darwin ex uh and do a podcast about Profectus AI ai and how all of that works and then through darwin ex we can invest in in all the talented builders on the pro active ai platform so i'm very excited about that uh we played around with darwin x and we are now half amillion funded i uh something like that right jo uh on just a simple algorithm we uploaded uh three years ago um and you get pay outs right we are this month up a lot and it's just an extra income stream and that's also with ft mo and other prop firms but there are a lot of things to do there but yeah that's uh to answer that funded question let's see in the questions in which channel the disco rd are you not in it you can also share the template here in the google all right guys any questions from me or nico or yo st updates or yeah go ahead you you do i want i can im mute you if you or you can do it yourself talk with us or just in the chat does late ncy affect much your strategies good question not really we are not really pursuing high frequency trading um we are personally manual traders so it's impossible to do e like very quick trading manually right so we really built a platform to transform all the manual traders into ago traders so not really focused on high frequency late ncy we do test with it like um mill ise con ds you can adjust that in MetaTrader but it doesn't really hurt our performance at all like we always have a big stop loss like minimum like 20 pip's uh with a strategy sometimes news hits yeah then you have maybe some slip page on your entry if you have a small stop loss and a little bit of slip page can have a high impact but it is a profitable strategy still profitable does the platform support using cross pairs so one bot over multiple pairs yeah MetaTrader 5 allows that um you can of course individually run an algorithm on one pair uh but you can also run the same algorithms on multiple pairs but you can also build an algorithm that analyze's all the pairs together and then based on that execute's so that uh that works yeah MetaTrader 5 allows that MetaTrader 4 doesn't but we are purely focused on five that you can build uh like that you any additions you want to uh say here um well for the strategy max just shared it's one of the more advanced uh strategies we've shared so far uh but we think it's a very good way of showing you that even though a a strategy might be a bit more complex it it's always uh possible to build it within the Profectus AI's platform right don't get intimidated by the amount of blocks that you see because i literally built the strategy i think in like 25 minutes from scratch um and yeah regardless of the number of blocks it's still very easy to do as long as you get the logic straight um and we've been receiving a lot of questions about can we do certain sm c concepts or concepts and this strategy has proved that indeed you can right uh there's a fair value gap in it which is relatively easy to program um and combine it with a proven concept such as a range breakout and you have a very solid strategy can i set it up uh a lot of questions just can i set it up so when i hit 2 for example over multiple pairs the bot will stop trading can you build that for now okay so basically um what it can do is you can close the trades at 2 right there's a closed trade block uh where you can set the condition that if my account hits 2 profit i want to close all trades that is possible but for now we don't have the option to shut down the ea or the bot entirely okay so closing trades at 2 profit yes but then you will have to shut down like the full system itself uh on your own for it to not take any trades anymore then javier um text input yeah that's nice that's a nice feedback there um yeah we'll look into that thanks yeah cool any other things you guys feel like okay i missed this in the platform or i really want this these are like the the times to talk about your experience right so kevin you're here as well uh you have been building quite a lot uh in the past year do you have like any things you miss in perfect's right now i don't think there's a lot of missing because the big difference is that to guys add a lot of template's so that makes it a lot easier for people in the beginning to build things uh i think one uh comment which was made in the call last month but i don't think that it's just implemented now was that if you could have a notebook uh in internally in pro act ctors where you could put notes of what you for example tested uh or why you made a certain code uh change because for example in another platform if you change the code up then you can't see the old code anymore you have to save it basically externally to and be able to import it but maybe it's and there was a comment i think of last time last call that somebody said if you guys could build like a notebook something there where you could basically put your thoughts in in it so that for now that's the only thing i see that's maybe missing yeah no taking yeah we have a very small feature on the platform right now um but it is very limited and we are working on uh i'll share my screen uh right now you have project properties and then here you have description so you can type here uh what your strategy is but it's a little bit hidden right um you can also add a link and then you find that link in your library so maybe an fx blue link with a track record or dar in x link or whatever it is or my fx book uh but we have only this description uh for now but we want to have it here on the canvas right that's what you what you you like to have just yeah yeah exactly that maybe somebody's for example building a project and then he's building multiple versions and then uh he has somewhere in the system a notebook where for example like in my experience like some people build all day but some people build multiple days a week so then you go back to a code go out of code might be nice to have somewhere where you can actually write down what you have tested the last time or where you were busy with basically yeah all right yeah we um we are a little bit busy with it uh but we will push it more uh to really have it on the canvas and bigger and that you can uh store per project your notes so it's not like general note taking aking on your account but more like per project you can uh write down your notes and also maybe that's what i'm thinking about now is let's say you're making a a al go and you're testing uh multiple versions of it maybe it's interesting to have like a folder where you can set okay this is the uh bt c breakout al go and then you can put all versions of the al go for example one with a turtle trail one with uh the the pi trail then you can put them all together because for example in the other platform you then have to search between all those codes within your versions maybe that's interesting as well okay nice nice i like that a lot yeah that's a that's a very good one more questions can you guys maybe explain the logic of fair value gap in the pro actic e builder we can can do that uh will that be a lot uh it's pretty quick we can do it very quickly if you can open the project um for the template we just shared because that's the beauty of the platform it's so easy um all right let me quickly and other questions jo can you cover them so for you andrew um you're now in disco rd i just approved you um is there a tutor ial in the disco rd well we have all our tutor ials and guides within the help center which max explained earlier okay so doc's per fa xi's ai is our full on help center with all tutor ials okay let's uh go for the fair value gap so here you see more tutor ials uh about how it works and otherwise the big tip is youtube prof ctors ai tutor ials and more and more videos will uh come there also i see in the chat en so is here as well he has a dutch community where he educate's also people about building with perfect so if you're dutch maybe that's something for you all right yo's can you see my screen yeah there we go okay so um fore nzo about the fair value gap you see what i did with the last blocks the modify variable block i named them to see which section does what right first section range breakout and the second section the big one it says f g found so basically the uh three blocks above that modify variable indicate the candle rules for the fair value cap and very simply what i did so no that one yes from there there you go what i did is i take three candles which really if you know a fair value gap um if you can visual ize that for yourself you can look up the concept and you very clearly see the image and it can be done in three blocks okay it takes three candles the first rule here i say candle low for candle id one has to be higher than the candle high of candle id 3 right okay yeah it gets super complex if i'm going to explain it candle by candle but maybe um the easiest thing to explain is that indeed it's possible with only three blocks because you take three candles and within perfect ors you can assign all the candle properties within one block right with a candle property i mean a high a low a close a wi ck whatever it is and it's really simple if you look up a visual ization an image of what a fair value gap looks like you can super easily build it in perfect ors using pre condition blocks free trade rule blocks okay um i don't think it makes much it makes a whole lot of sense of going over every block right now because that takes too much time but i hope you get the idea uh also by max opening the blocks you see how easy it actually is yeah so the big tip also for us uh how we always build ourselves is to visual ize it first i always have a like a real easy notebook and this notebook is filled with my notes about if i build something i draw it out first or if you have like a pattern like maybe a wedge pattern or whatever pattern of the markets a chart pattern i first draw it out and really think about what do i need how many candles do i need and all of that and then do it step by step so google fair value gap then you see candles tick pattern and then the high is above that high the low of that candle is above that low and so you just build more questions we can also do a tutor ial on it right we can just make a a proper youtube video about how to build a strategy like this but this strategy is for you guys for the web ina r so uh we really want to yeah maybe another fair value strategy we share online um yeah i can very quickly answer eric nora's question um because what you're asking is about calculating um something for instance the last 20 em as uh their close price basically when it comes down to calculating or calculating averages or sum ming up something we have something that's called the formula block um and in the formula block what you can do is take three values right um for instance if you want to calculate an average you take two values you add them up and divide it by two right you can do the same for three four five how many values it might be um so to simply answer your question yes you can do that in the formula block and you use a variable to assign the values to it if that's too advanced for you you can um easily find how variables and formulas work in our help center which will explain you everything but this is the outright answer just uh find inputs and variables and then you can uh can learn more about it but we will uh topic also to maybe make a dedicated video on right then we have that's also a good one nico shared more trading bots of the other library yeah for for what what kevin just brought up um about the stress testing this is something we sometimes do to verify results if we think they might be too good to be true what we mean by this is simply that if we run run a back test the met trader 5 even though we have the highest quality of tick data sometimes it could be the case that the real life market environment is different in your tick data from what you're used to in your live trading so what we do then is move over and stress test using variable spreads and commissions this is super difficult super advanced um but in general this is how we do it and if we share a project with you it's always stress tested okay so any template or um ea we share from Profectus AI has been stress tested all right as a buyer of the machine and crack the code is it possible to have the code in perfect to adjust and export using my own settings preferences no we work with a license key so um what happens is of course if you you guys are going to build strategies on this platform and maybe you have so many strategies you want to sell a few uh to other people to help them out um and all of that or make like an eco'm business around it and that's also something we support right uh we have been sharing and selling strategies as well um and how we do that is if we sell a strategy we put a license key in it so that people cannot they buy it and they cannot sell keep selling it like sharing the the files with others so um if you sell things al always just sell the x 5 or the x 4 file with a license key so therefore we we don't uh allow up loading it to to prof ac us because then you can just continue to export it right in export u x 5 and distribute it like one person buys it and then 100 people have it that's a protection for uh for the seller uh the project you shared for the today is for the ducks but you can also test it on the's p 500 but it's made for the ducks so stock indices yeah but like every strategy you can trade on every market the crypt o stocks or uh fx just test it and see what the results tell you that's the the key thing here all right guys then i think we covered a lot of questions what is it that you guys would like to see more is it more template's more strategy if you can choose more educational stuff more template's more live sessions can choose one thing what's the what has the highest impact on your results template with education okay so we share a template and then we explain step by step for like 30 minutes how it exactly works and how to build it with us that is uh maybe nice okay it would be great cool all right guys leave and continue with the day and start building all right guys see you next month great you're here uh next month more people and more updates",

    "text": "welcome to Profectus AI let's build your first winning strategy together let's see the strategy on the charts and then build it in Profectus AI in MetaTrader 5 you can see my back test of the trading strategy we're building you can see that a trade was taken here the trading plan states that you take a trade when the candles tick closes above the middle line of the ball inger band and we use a trailing stop loss we bought here and sold there you back test your strategy fast to see if the results are good here you see the back test results and here the list of trades taken so let's move to Profectus AI ai let's start from scratch we have the breakout strategy we tested it on pound yen the 1 hour time frame but you can of course test it on whatever symbol or time frame once every 1 hour on monday and tuesday only check if price breaks the ball inger band middle line trades are managed with a trailing stop loss let's now apply the template what do we have here we have two decision trees one tree moving from top to bottom and then tree number two we can hold shift and select the blocks every 1 hour i want to check something we can put it on current like this and adjust the time frame in MetaTrader 5 or scroll the list the second rule is run in session i only want to move on to the next tasks if we're in a current session if you click on it se ver time means it takes the clock of your MetaTrader terminal the time is set at 9 00 to 20 00 this is the session i want to trade the days i have selected are monday and tuesday you can also select other days click on the canvas and the block closes and saves then the training rule block the most important block what we need to do is create this trading rule check if price breaks the ball inger band middle line so if we open the block we have two things we compare with each order see the list of options here we compare a candle with the ball inger band indicator in this case candles tick close id one needs to be above the ball inger band middle line just like i've showed you at the start of the video on the charts so what is candle id MetaTrader has a counting system which is simple current price has the candle id zero the latest and most recently closed candles tick is identified as candle id 1 and the candle before that candle id 2 you can keep counting to the left like this so here the most recently closed candle closed above the middle line that's what we want to check if that is true we move to the next block if it was not true the algorithm stops and the next hour it runs again count trades what is this well i just want to check if i have no trades open or no orders placed then buy pending order start with deciding where to place your order this strategy places the buy order at the most recently closed candle high that is candle id one let's talk money management i want to risk 1 of my account balance on one trade now stop loss and take profit i always use them yeah i use percentage of price but you can also simply use pip's for my take pro fi't i want a high risk to reward ratio in this example i use a target that is 950 times larger than my stop loss after i place an order i want to automatically del ete the order if i am not triggered within 2 hours now let's talk what happens when the algorithm takes a buy trade every 1 hour i want to select my open trade then i want to check how much profit my trade is currently running if it is running above 1 in profit i want to modify my stop loss i don't want to change or update my target so this is turned false stop loss is set to true and i place my stop loss at candle id 5 low's this runs every 1 hour but i can of course let the algorithm check my profits earlier if i want to now let's watch the charts because the algorithm is done the order here is placed at the candle id 1 high the stop loss was trailing and ended up at this wi ck being stopped out for profits",

    "text": "welcome to Profectus AI the no ode platform for building trading bots on MetaTrader 5 in this video we're building a range breakout strategy for gold inspired by trader renee balk this version is simplified compared to the usd jp y system but it still follows the same portfolio logic and does not require a pro subscription you'll find the full portfolio breakdown and article linked down below as always remember past performance is not a promise of future returns what you'll learn here is not just how this specific bot works but also how to build it step by step understanding the core logic the building blocks and all the details so you can apply the same concepts to your own trading systems we are building now the range breakout on gold inspired by renee bal ker this is actually now a free version because we simplified it we don't need to check the range width as we did it for us dollar japanese yen that makes it much easier for us to create this trading system just a quick rec ap it is based also on the 5'm minute time frame it checks the range again between 3 00 am 3 05 and 6 05 so 6 00 am so it's a little bit of a longer uh time range we are now checking here again placing exactly actually the pending order so here we are actually using pending orders on the highs and low's that are detected the stop loss is defined as simply 1 of the price of gold so here gold would need to move 1 against us to hit our stop loss we again have no take pro fi't and we also only take one trade per day how do we close the trade again we close the trade at 6 55 pm in the evening this is pretty much the whole logic of this trading system and now let's again build it from ground we start directly with the juicy part by placing the pending orders so here we simply use the block run at time we run at 6 05 then we simply want to check do you have any trades open and if that is not the case fantastic then we can actually continue so we change it here it has to be 0 0 for buys and for sells and now we go already into the by pending and sell pending order blocks so this needs to be true this needs to be true let's start with the buy pending order block and here since we don't enter directly as with a buy now block we have to define the price level where the pending order is being placed so here we want to define a custom price based on market property again you know before the drill we want to check what is the highest price based on the time period so here we simply punch in the time i mentioned before 305 until 60 5 so time range of 3 hours we want to get the price value once again price offset zero and that is already the definition for placing the pending orders now for the money management here it's quite straightforward because we actually have a stop loss we keep it at risk percent of balance at one so 1 of your balance will be at risk the maximum you could lose in this trading system then the next one for the stop loss and take profit we define it as 1 of the complete price very interesting concept so we keep it as here it is by default and also the take profit we change to no take profit then we go to order ex piration we make this based on a fixed time at 6 55 pm and that is the complete magic for the buy pending order let's quickly do it also for the sell pending order we open here once more on custom price market property lowest price based on time candle server time 305 and 60 5 we want to get the price value offset at zero the money management one more time 1 of the of your balance you have available stop loss also same as on the other side it is 1 of the price so we keep it as it is by default we change this take profit definition to no take profit and the order ex piration is again at 65 5 in the evening cool so this is so this so much to the juicy part where we are placing the pending orders of this trading system now we define the decision trees where we are closing open trades so the pending orders has been triggered so now we want to create the logic where we are managing the open trades so we again as so often start with a time block when to trade so run at time we do this at 6 55 in the evening and yes indeed now what we are defining is actually redundant but i will show you anyway um just a different way how you can also close trades and if you're interested in for instance partially closing trades you can do so with this logic so the next block is the select trade block here we simply say cool all the open trades on both sides buys and sells we want to close them so you want to here close trades connected to 100 so here you can for example also change it to 50 if you only want to close out 50 of the whole position now on the other side let's copy this block very quickly we also want to make sure that at the end of our trading session so here at 6 55 evening we are closing all the pending orders buys and sells yep yep so here we take the del ete order block we connect it so there's nothing to change and this is it for this group of blocks so now we also want to make sure not only at the end of our trading session that we are closing trades and del eti ng pending orders we also want to make sure that the other pending order is being cancelled right as soon as we hit for example the by pending order the closed pending order is closed so we don't open more than one trade a day so here we use the run per tick it's very important this block just is the most precise block to trigger the next one since it's per tick and here we simply check how many trades do we have open here we do it for the buys only right so we want to see trade count is bigger than zero order count must be zero here in that case then we select all the pending orders so here select trades again pending orders that all pending orders that are short we are now del eti ng them so we click here on del ete orders and here we are simply making sure that when we have a buy trade open that we now select all the short pending orders and we del ete them now we do the same also for the buys so again we start with the run per tick i mean you can also're use it but here we'll just use the run per tick block we again counting the traits count trade block connect do we have any trades open here we do it for cells only and we also must select select trades connected here want to select the pending orders that are going along so here it is already by default buys only and then we also use the last block del ete orders and now this is the complete logic of the gold range breakout inspired by rene be r",

    "text": "welcome to Profectus AI the no ode platform for building trading bots on MetaTrader 5 in this video we're breaking down the gold range breakout strategy a simple yet powerful bot inspired by renee balk and part of the six bot portfolio you'll find linked below i'll show you exactly how the system works what logic drives it and how you can't we ak it in Profectus AI to make it your own past performance is never a promise of future returns but understanding the structure behind a live tested strategy like this one can seriously level up your own builds let's jump straight in let me quickly explain the trading rational of the strategy and how this trading bot will trade we're looking at the gold against the us dollar trading chart on the 15 min ut time frame the time frame does not matter that much and you will understand in a second why what is the trading bot doing it is checking at 3 hour time frame starting from 3 00 am until 6 00 am checking for highs and low's so here for example we are at 3 00 am this is 6 00 am marked by this vertical line and then what this trading b simply does it is checking the highest high and the lowest low of this time period so let's quickly mark this up so for example the highest high has been at the beginning of this time range at 3 00 am we'll put one line here the lowest price has been around 4 00 am so we'll put a horizontal line exactly there the trading bot will do the same pretty much detecting the price levels of this 3 ho ur time range and as soon as price is breaking out now in that case to the downs ide a trade will be taken short exactly here in this moment this upper price level will be deleted so even though if price would go again the other direction the buy trade would not be taken you can be sure it only takes one trade per day what will it do it will simply take 1 of the complete price level we will enter here 1 to the upside is somewhere here so the price level will be somewhere in this area the take profit is also not defined in this trading strategy it will simply close the trade at 700 pm so here in this candle that would mean the price until here this would be the exemplary trade taken by this trading system now let's find an example where price is breaking out to the upside here we have the 3 ho ur time period from 3 00 am until 6 00 am what is the trading bot doing placing or recognizing the highest high this has been here in this area the lowest low of this time period has been somewhere here then we see price is breaking out to the upside then again the stop loss is 1 of the price somewhere here at 3 321 let's quickly adjust it to this price level and then let's quickly mark when the position will be closed that will be here and we will close it exactly when this candle is also closing so that will be somewhere here with a big win but this is also the reality of this trading system the stop loss is pre de fine'd what is a best practice we really like to see that our downs ide is definitely protected and the upside is unlimited what is quite nice so we don't say we want to see a risk to reward ratio of 1 1 or 1 5 it is simply based on time so when you have a big movement in the market such as as when we saw it for example here relatively big but it could be even bigger once in a while we will also see it later in a visual back test on MetaTrader 5 these are the moments where this system is really banking the big bucks for you going into the back test report based on gold back test on the past 6 and a half years starting from 2018 this is a long enough time period to back test that we also really suggest in the community to go for it you see here or the inputs we used not exactly 3 00 am until 6 am actually 5 minutes and the clusters on exactly at 7 00 pm but actually at 6 55 and these are exactly the inputs you can play around quickly highlighting one of the most important aspects of the australian strategy in these six and a half years the returns has been roughly 140 what translates in more than 20 of returns on average per year we have a win ratio of a little bit above 50 51 43 per so almost 505 0 and a little bit more than than that and we are very comfortable with these numbers because the average profit trade sits at 80 82 and the average loss trade at only 69 97 so this is pretty much where the edge of that system comes in plus the draw down is in a healthy ratio to the returns sitting at 15 39 based on the equity draw down's which is higher than the balance draw down here so this is really the max we have been testing here in this time period our return to draw down ratio sits at roughly nine and usually we speak of a viable system when we have a ratio of bigger than two this is the balance curve you can expect when you're back testing the strategy and when you would have traded for the past years you see there are some periods where the system is indeed stall ing but then you also see when the market is really moving in bigger steps that this is the periods where you also bank bigger thanks pretty much to the open take profit price levels here and what i also really like about this balance curve is it's not the most beautiful balance curve where you see like usually a straight line which is always kind of a signal of either using a grid system missing stop loss so you're simply not realizing the losses here you do realize the losses sign to you as a potential like potential person who is interested having such a trading system in your portfolio and the beauty is you can actually get it as i already mentioned earlier by simply checking out the link down below in the video description and you can even add your own fantasy to it by adding new trading blocks as i will explain in just a second how to do so just one of the many ideas like high level you can check for instance are the periods why are we stall ing here or even in a slight down tre nd this is probably one of these periods where you are in a draw down of around 15 and then you can see why did it happen what can we add what kind of indicators price action patterns whatsoever could we add to the system to overall improve it now let me show you actually this trading system in visual mode on MetaTrader 5 just to pretty much show you also what you can expect when trading this viable system on your own account so here we are looking at the 15 min ut time frame and what i have explained before you will now see fully automated on the charts so it's a little bit more he ctic faster and i think also pretty much the fun of trading such a system we are now here at 2 am you see the time on the right hand side when i'm hovering over which is pretty much so showing us the candle time so now for the next candle stop it right here we are now starting to detect what is the lowest what is the highest price so here pretty much the current lowest price would be here let's see what the system is doing further and we expect the price at around 6 what is the term right here 4 30 we'll stop detecting the highest and the lowest price level we are here sitting at 5 am the next because we're on 15 min ut time frame will close the look back period what the trading system is doing fully automated it's placing not actually placing but detecting the price level here has been the highest of the past 3 hours this one has been at the lowest of the past 3 hours and now we will see what the system is doing we see that the system is now breaking out to the upside and it is taking the trade exactly at the price level of this candle's high it is placing a stop loss here which is exactly 1 of the complete price of gold now we will expect as explained before that the system will close the trade at 6 55 pm independently if it's now in a loss or a profit it is simply closing definitely the trade when we're hitting here this stop loss just in case of a well worst case pretty much that we don't lose our complete account and this is really what we want to see in a viable trading system because then you can feel comfortable trading such a system long term now let's fast en it up a little bit we are at 56 and now let's quickly stop it here and go to the history we see at 65 5 we closed the trade with a return of almost 9k this is one of the many examples we can now watch here on the charts how the system is trading let's run it through again to get another example of this trading system we again pretty much saw here was 4 am indeed the lowest price and then somewhere here 6 00 am ending the highest price now the price is breaking down to the downs ide and we see how price is developing to the downs ide the stop loss is quite far away but we're comfortable with it we set the risk to 1 so the worst case scenario here is pretty much that we are losing 1 of our trading account if the stop loss is hit and obviously these are one of the many settings you can adjust yourself either within MetaTrader or on the platform of Profectus AI ai either you want to have a fixed risk or what we're doing here based on a percentage of your complete trading account on percentage's or you want to simply make fixed pip's or is also some pe sometimes a viable way to do it so that is really up to you and you can test around for example you can also play around with the stop loss do you want to have a big stop loss of 1 it is quite ing eni ous i must say what rene be r was doing here because to hit a stop loss that is 1 away from your entry point the market really has to move against you this is a very interesting way not only for this kind of range breakout based on gold but for so many other trading systems as well that you might want to trade or back test so i would definitely say keep this trading approach in mind for other strategies you build in the future on Profectus AI because i find this quite ing eni ous i must say to have such a stop loss in place this is the dna of this range breakout for gold which you can get on factors ai for free you see here the pro version which involves variables and inputs so you can easily adjust the settings within MetaTrader and back test it with different settings in our team we worked hard on building a system that is the same pretty much but ci rc um venting using variables and inputs so also if you are not comfortable getting the pro subscription yet you can also get it for free with some limitations regarding back testing and input capabilities so you can definitely check out the link down below in the video description getting access to the free version of this training bot i will also link the pro version down below which is definitely more fun and also giving you access to so many more interesting trading bots running through the dna to give you a little bit of an ups kill ing session here how to not only adjust this trading system but also build your own trading systems from scratch but also the many template's we're providing you here and in our trading bot library which you can easily access here clicking on it looking for the trade bot library and then you see we have many other systems also another gold strategy built on price action and also sc ul ping grid strategy even though i would not say it's a long term viable strategy but definitely a lot of fun to test yourself back testing adjusting it and there are also components in it that are definitely viable in combination with different kind of trading rational's then we have a different kind of breakout strategy presenting here to you and also like for example momentum strategy couple of management styles as well and this library is expanding as we speak so definitely check it out by simply clicking on the links the new project will open up for you was really just click and drop you can also export it here in the upper right corner the execution file get it run on your MetaTrader 5 platform to use these systems straight away now getting into the dna run in session you see here we used the variable start and end trading we define it here from 305 until 60 5 this is pretty much triggering the next block so you read it from top to bottom like a decision tree so here on the left hand side you see pretty much all those blocks that are well defining the conditions to enter long and on the right hand side the conditions to enter short going through the blocks for the buy section the trade rule we simply check with this block did we already enter a trade yes or no the variable buy trade is set at zero by default bench mark ed against the value zero if this is still zero this condition block or this condition dot which is the check mark triggers because condition is true and as soon as we take a trade we buy here modify the variable to one and then this condition would have been triggered but it's not connected to anything that is why this trading system is making sure to always only take one position per day so you have complete control and you can even adjust this yourself by playing around with the variables so you are maybe also comfortable taking more trades than one then the next block is getting triggered here we simply check what is the current ask price and we trigger this true condition as soon as the ask price is crossing over this means the x and the bigger than symbol so it's crossing over the highest price between the periods we just defined before so the starting period and the end period so between 3 and 6 am and what do we want to get so we want to get the price value that is why we choose here the price value not the time value these are also the settings you can look for when you're building something different but here we are interested in the price value meaning what is the highest price between 305 and 60 5 cool then we check what are the current open trades if they are zero fantastic we trigger the next one and this is where you can also play around with the numbers in prof us and export this version yourself don't forget to adjust it for the sell conditions to have just an equilibrium so to say so if you indeed in that case no trades are opened the buy now block will get triggered and this is also pretty much what we have seen on the charts we risk here a percentage of our balance the risk is a variable in the free version it would be a number and not an input so you can't adjust it with the MetaTrader 5 but here we had it as a variable as an input so you can also adjust it convenient ly within MetaTrader 5 next to the stop loss and take profit the stop loss is based on the percentage of the price here's the variable again stop loss and the stop loss is by default defined by 1 now let's put it back to the input take profit we don't have a take profit right pretty much what is our take profit is that we are auto cl osing the open trades here on a fixed time on end trading end trading is again a variable because it's a pro version in the free version we would simply punch in a 65 5 so it would be simply a number so you can't adjust it in MetaTrader since we are using the inputs you can easily do that within MetaTrader and back test it maybe you want to close it earlier or later this is the beauty of having inputs and variables now this block is important in combination with that block because this block is changing the buy and sell trade variable to one and here this block is pretty much just making sure that we stop entering more trades after one trade has been taken either sell or buy we don't really care but we also want to trade the next day right because otherwise we would only take one trade so at 65 5 we would again change these variables back to zero so we un block the values in these two blocks on the upper side so we can take a trade to the up or downs ide this is the dna of the trading system definitely worth while checking out down below in the video description ask your questions not only in the comment section but also reach out to our disco rd community you can join by clicking on disco rd community or asking your questions via the help center well first of all check it out yourself by just looking up the help center articles but you can also reach out to us by sending us amessage but definitely i think worth while is also checking out the disco rd community",

    "text": "So if you guys have any questions feel free to drop them in the chat. I'm going to move through this whole keynote and then at the end I share a strategy with you as always. I think it will be a very interesting session because we're going to talk about prop firms how to get funding and also my overall journey towards profitable trading and how you can use profactus to reach that. So Profactus AI first of all what is it? What is our mission? Well, simplifying automated trading for everyone is our goal. Why we started this company. But what is Profactus AI? Well, real quick, it's the easy tole learn no code builder to automate any trading strategy allowing everyone to trade FX, crypto, and stocks uh automatically. So, with algorithms, but without having to code. So we built a no coding platform for every trader to just automate your trading plan and then use it in the markets to stay consistent and be consistent while you work out, while you sleep, while you do whatever you want to do during the day, your trades are taken and managed. So I always have this statement, if you were trading for a living tomorrow, you use perfect AI. And what I mean with that is is to figure out, okay, how can you really achieve your goal with trading? And when I started 10 years ago, my goal was to live from this, be independent, be a trader, make money from the markets. And that's why I started learning this skill. And I think if you master Proactors AI, the software platform, then you can reach this goal. And I'm going to dive into that. Why? Let's break it down. The goal, the method, and the metrics, the three steps to take. The goal first is becoming free, independent, making return on your capital, maybe reach financial freedom or whatever it is. That was my goal and I think it's very similar to the goals you guys have. The method is having a profitable strategy and how to know that the strategy is profitable is by testing it and seeing results in the live markets but also seeing results in your back test. So you need a strategy that worked last year the year before that but also that works this year right that is how I define a profitable strategy. So that's the method to reach this goal. But what are the metrics? And the metrics are often forgotten. And this is where the journey of every trader comes down to executing the strategy perfectly. I can give you the most profitable strategy on earth. But still, because some trades happen while you sleep, some trades happen while you're just not at the charts or you're emotional and you don't execute the trades. Those are all reasons why you're not reaching this goal. So, Pracus AI is built to help you find those profitable strategies, but also execute them without error. And that's the goal of also this call and every call we do every month is to help you find those strategies, build those strategies, test them to see for yourself that they work and then you can reach your goal that you well you started trading for, right? So to go back if you were trading for a living tomorrow you use profactus AI this every time I share this statement just think about the goal the method and the metrics. All right. So, I'm currently uh standing to the right there. You can see that they upgraded the screen. But here you can see I'm standing here on the trading floor and this is the history of this trading floor. And why this is important is because to the left you see a lot of chaos, a lot of people standing here, these desks like this all this wasn't there, right? You can see that a screen didn't exist. And why I'm telling that is because here in Amsterdam uh in the 17th century it all started. uh we in Amsterdam the people living here invented the stock market the first uh company and when that happened also price action was discovered right prices move and therefore technical analysis was used by people here already hundreds of years ago and some people still trade like the same technical analysis from back then right so that was the first invention then the second invention was um the computers existed right market data exploded there were more companies like that first uh stock market company that just went more and more and more companies and therefore there was so much data uh creating a tech revolution and human beings couldn't really handle it so it had to be automated then we had the next invention and that was PCs this allowed data analysis beyond human capacity this is where the Jim Simons like the the billionaire hedge fund manager that started with automating technical analysis started that During this time when PCs existed or started to uh pop up everywhere, the professionals, the hatchants started to automate what manual traders were doing and this was gamechanging. This literally created billionaires u in our industry in the trading and investing space. Then the next invention was the internet and the internet created market access for everyone. You and me, we're not talking through the internet, right? But also I can access my broker account and every financial market through the internet now by my phone, by my laptop. And this changed everything like even more data, more people could trade, more volume, more liquidity, markets became safer and better uh and easier to to trade. And then right now, where are we currently? Well, you can call this more or less the cloud and the AI um period. You can automate anything. You can test it. You can trade it and you can get funded. And this is uh ridiculous that we are so lucky that we're now able to trade in this time, right? It is never it has never been easier to automate anything, test it if it really works, to trade it, to access the markets, and also how to get funded. Back in the days, it was super hard to uh to get funding and get money to trade with, right? So how I define a modern profitable trader is someone that moved through these five steps. Study the basics of analysis. This can be technical analysis. This can be fundamental analysis. Doesn't really matter. But at least you know the basics of the markets. If you don't, there's so much information online about the basics. What is a pip? What is what is trading? How to buy and sell? How to work with a broker. Right? That's step one. I think most of you guys here are well past that step one. But some of you guys are stuck at step two and that is the skill of automation. Uh back in the days you had to become a developer, learn to code for many years and then you were able to automate a strategy. Still it took you a lot of time and hours and months or years even to automate one strategy. But now we teach you guys the skill or offer you a platform where you can learn the skill to automate your trading plan without writing any code. So you can build way quicker. you can instead of you having to code a strategy, you can now drag and drop it and you can build well 10 times faster than a developer. So that is step two and then step three is able to back test very quickly. Like I said, uh if you didn't test your strategy, how do you know it works, right? So it's very important to test the strategy because if it worked in the past it's likely to work in the future at least more likely than if you didn't test something or you test something and it is really a bad system then you know it probably won't work in the future right so step three is super important and then four is trades without any errors. How do you do that? Well, automation solves more or less all the problems uh for manual traders. And that's just because yeah, the trade is executed. It's followed by the plan. There are no emotions involved. Yeah. The charts when they move, a trade is taken, right? Uh instead of you having to be stuck to your charts and then has large capital opportunities. This is like that step five that is so important to talk about and that is the topic of today's webinar. So before I continue, any questions guys? All right. So, capital, how to get it and how to keep it. My journey was uh a lot different because it started 10 years ago. So, there weren't prop firms or I didn't no prop firms existed. I don't think there were prop firms 10 years ago. But, so my journey was very uh different compared to what traders have right now. But we also walk the prop firm journey as well. And that is what we're going to talk about. So, method one is using prop firms online. today's topic and in future webinars maybe I do a a session about how I did it how I got private capital and started to go uh walk that path more or less the old way of doing things. All right so method one using prop firms online is how to get capital real quick for people that don't know what a prop firm is a company that provides capital and resources to skilled traders so they can trade on its behalf in financial markets. So a company invests in you, you trade that company for a profit split. They win, you win, right? That is at least what you think. The skill uh the skill test uh companies give you to to you to prove that you actually can trade, right? The prop firm tests the trader skill by giving a trading challenge. Normally you get a trading account. You need to make 10% uh following a lot of rules. And if you make that 10%, you pass the challenge. And then you have a second challenge and that's the verification where you need to make another 5% or more or less that is the the system most firms offer uh like FTMO like that is one of the biggest one in the world has this skill test. Then what's the business model from their uh their point of view? Well the trader pays the prop firm for that skill test. So to take that skill you need to to pay them a few hundred bucks. And if the trader wins and he proves that he can trade, he passes the 10% and the 5% he gets capital and they refund the money he paid for the skill test. Right? So that's the business model, how it works from a prop firm point of view. The statistics, how does this work in real life? Well, most traders fill the test and a prop firm makes a lot of money because they keep the money that people pay for uh for the skill test, right? The money is used to pay out the select few of traders that actually do pass the skill test and make money. So you have a lot of people losing and uh selection making money. We are one of those people and in this call probably many of you guys have been working with prop firms and got payouts. But that is the business model. You have a lot of losing traders and they pay the winning traders because you're not actually trading real capital. You're trading in demo account. So if you make 10k profits, that money didn't really exist, but they still pay you your profit split. Yeah. All right. So FTMO is the biggest one to prove how much money this industry is making with prop firms is insane. I put in uh from last year August there is the turnover of FTMO. They made 213 million um which is ridiculous. So this is really an industry on its own. But we're going to talk about how to beat them, right? How to how to still be at a good side in this overall plan. So, what I've learned in the building thousands of strategies uh over the past years is you have strategies to pass the skill test. So, the 10% and 5% for instance, you have specifically created strategies to achieve that. And you also have strategies to get payouts, right? So you have two types of strategies to pursue this and you mostly need two strategies. Sometimes you can use the same strategy but I'm not going to share that with you because I want to give you the highest probability to to make money with this. Right. Today we talk about payout strategies. Maybe in a future webinar we're going to talk about uh passing prop firms but right now we're going to talk about how to get the payouts consistently. This will blow your mind to be honest. So take your notes. The most consistently profitable algorithms you see online are the riskiest. Almost everything you see regarding bots and algorithms online are the most risky systems with the best track records and the most consistent results. And I'm going to show you how that works, why that is uh the reason because if you don't know that, you can fall in a trap. And also if you know this, you can use it for prop terms. So, these systems have a very large stop-loss and a very small target. All right? Creating a very high win rate because it's so easy to hit your target versus your stop-loss. Imagine that you have a huge stop-loss and you have a very tiny target. The market just statistically is more likely to quickly tap your uh target than move all the way down to your stop- loss. Right? That's what I'm trying to say here. and therefore you have very high win rate but your risk-to-reward is negative for the more advanced traders creating profitable results. This strategy creating profitable results month in month out until the market does something crazy and blows up the account. This is probably uh the algorithm that you have seen everywhere online. uh if you ever Googled FX algorithms or whatever algorithm yeah you have seen very steep equity charts and I will show you examples I've seen these systems come and go for the past 10 years so I'm not just telling you I've seen this and it's sort of an obsession for me to see if people trade it on capital to see okay how long will they survive right so have here you create uh you have one that we created this is uh one of those strategies we built um together with my team. You can see it is super consistent, right? Every month of the 14 months is profit. The cumulative return is ridiculous. It is just a straight line, right? All right. So, it looks great indeed. I promise this account will blow up one day. Account gone, everything gone. It will be a minus 100% uh month. And why do I say that to you? Well, this is a risky system to run on private capital. Um but they always do they always explode. This one is now running for 14 months and one day maybe another 14 months will be very good and then it will be bad. Yeah, I will show you um why in a second. So here you have another system. This is not my system. This is a public system. This track record I've been following for many years. It's currently up 11,710% in profits. Yeah. but it blew up but the owner deposited double the money to save it. So you had a big draw down and then it was margin call and the owner had the money to double the account and saved it and that's what you can see here uh in the big spike right. So also this system blew up but yeah if it's a small account you can just double your money but if you do this on a on a million you better have a million in cash also laying there otherwise the million is gone right so this is how those strategies look and why do I talk about this why do I share this with you guys because yeah it's a little bit of a yeah a weird thing to share right to talk about systems that blow up well what if you can trade these strategies and not worry about blow blowing up. So you can be very consistent month in month out making half a percent 1% maybe more and not worrying about blowing up. Well, this is where prop firms come in because it's not your own capital. It's not even real capital. So if it blows up after x amount of months, you did collect the real money payouts, right? So I will bring this home for people that see this for the first time. I think whoa, what what is this? I'll slowly step by step show it to you. So if we go back to to our track record here, you count 14 profitable months equaling 14 payouts from prop firms, right? When we blow up, I already made good returns. So one of our founders of Profus is also here in the chat and he proved this for almost a year now that since December running this system on FTMO on prop firms and getting payouts, right? And this is what I'm about to teach you today. And also give you a strategy that does this. And then you can test it for yourself. Of course, um you need to test it yourself and play around with it. So of course your own decision, but I just want to show you how to build these type of strategies on proactives AI because a long time ago I made the promise you can automate anything. So also these type of systems. So how the industry names these crazy stupid and risky strategies is normally either martingale grid systems or sculping systems. Yeah, you have you can really investigate a lot of systems you see online and they probably look like this or that and then they have a big draw down uh floating but they close in profits and they do generate uh consistent returns but one day they blow up but on prop firms it doesn't really matter right because you have more payouts than uh than the probability of losing the account. So far questions. Let me quickly check how that um again never use these on real capital not worth the risk to reward. So for some of you guys you might build uh take the strategy we share today and you uh change it a little bit be creative learn from it and do all of that and then you're thinking like oh maybe I do run it on private capital. Of course, it's your money. Do what with it, whatever. But my disclaimer is pretty clear, right? These strategies are risky but consistent. And um what you will figure out is like if you make a 100% gain because your draw down is 100%. Right? If you know that you might lose your account, you need to have crazy good returns every month to cover that 100%. So therefore, it's not worth the risk to reward. You can calculate it yourself, but it is for prop firms ideal. To follow prop firm rules, it is important that you adjust the strategy. The entries, the exits, everything needs to be adjusted because we are not allowed to all trade the same strategies. Um, so when you start with a strategy like this, when you do trust that you tested it yourself, it's important to adjust it and therefore you need to learn a little bit about how to use perfect AI. So let's dive into that. Let's build a strategy like this step by step and then I share with you the a link the link will be shared here in the Google uh meets later on and then yeah you can just click on it and if you don't have an account sign up and then download it and play around with it adjust it export it and run it. All right. So this is the equity chart uh on a CAD on the 15minut time frame. So 15 and this is what the strategy I'm about to share with you. It's very consistent. It is not the same strategy as this. This is a different strategy but ID is the same and it's also uh well you can test for yourself right. All right trading plan for buys. Let's dive into the trading plan because first we need to know what is this doing step by step and then how to transform the trading plan in building blocks in perfect AI. So we have three u rules here for buy. So what do I need to see the market doing to buy and of course also for sales. What does the market need to show me before I click sell? Of course we are not manually clicking buy and sell. The algorithm will do that. Um, we're living in uh 2025, right? Every 15 minutes, check candle closed is below the bowlinger band low. I will show you a chart example soon. Then check if we don't have trades open, then buy with a lot size, an x amount of lots. If we do have trades open, check how far away we are from this trade and use a different lot size. So it's possible that you take a buy, price goes against you and then you take another buy. So you have two positions open, sometimes you have three positions open, sometimes you have four positions open. Yeah, I'll show you with examples. Then the trading plan for sells is the same but then check uh every 15 minutes check candle closed is above the bowlinger bands high. Super simple strategy. This works on so many strate uh so many different uh simple rules. We have check if we don't have trades open then sell with this lot size and then if we do have trades open check how far away we are from this trade and use a different lot size. Pretty easy trading plan right? All right. How does that look? Well, here we have the algorithm uh opened. When you open a profactive AI algorithm, you can see you can recognize the colors that this created on our platform and you see the bowlinger band, right? So you see uh more or less a moving channel with three lines. You have the lower line, the midline and the high uh higher line, the top line. Well, the rule for a cell if we go back is check candle closed above the band high. Well, we see that right now. Right now the trade is taken. We have a sell and we have a huge target uh huge stop loss and a very tiny target as I I explained. What happens when p price moves higher? Well, then I want another sell because one day it will do that. So I forwarded it and now you have a sell trade one that's to the left. You have sell trade two to the right. So you were in a sale, price moved against you, you took another sell, and then the the floating profit of both of the systems was positive, and then you close all cell trades. But we're going to dive into that a little bit more now, but this is how the strategy works. You can also see in the middle, I don't know if you can clearly see, but in the middle there was also a buy trade taken. Uh buy trade taken, and it was a quick win. But let's focus on these sell trades now. And well let's buy the uh also do the buy side. So every 15 minutes check candle closed below the bowlinger band low is now transformed to five blocks in profactus AI. We have block number one run pair candle. We have block number two run in session. We have then a trading rule. We have count trades and we have a buy now. These are five blocks you need right now and we're going to build more and more and more. So run per candle. What does that mean? Well, every candlestick close, I want to look at the charts and see if we have a break of that bowlinger band high, right? Or the low. All right. So, the algorithm always starts with run per candle. Then run in session a block is used when to trade. Well, normally you trade almost all the hours because FX is almost 24 hours a day open. So, you want to trade let's say 22 hours um per day. That is what you do here. So every candlestick close on a 15minut time frame run in session and then the trade rule. Well, can you guess it? What is the trade rule? Check if the candle close uh that just closed is below the bowlinger band. All right, then check if we don't have trades open then buy with this lot size. What you can see here is count trades. Well, the name already tells you we are counting if we have any trades open. Well, right now we don't have trades open. So that is also valid. And then we have buy now and the trade is executed. You have that that happened here. But then this is a sell example. Um and then this is done. Okay. Now that is just one trade. We have now another tree. And this is a lot of copy paste work. It's just copy paste copy paste. So it's not really getting more complex the more blocks we use. But we have a lot of trades we need to take. So if we have one trade open, if we are far away from that trade one, I want to take trade two if the candle closes again below the bowling band. So that is what we did see here with this example. U again for sales, we had a close above uh that level and then I'm looking to get a sell to uh trade two. Right? So you can see here we have a second tree again run per candle on the 15-minut time frame running in that same session but now we count if we have a buy one trade open. You can just do that select that in the that block itself and then select uh that buy one trade. So select the trade that was already open. Then check how much profits it is running. Is it running 15 pips in profit or is it running uh in a in a loss? How far away is it current price and that all trade because you don't want to enter more trades on the same level, right? You want to see markets far away from that first trade and then trade rule. Well, trade rule is close on the below the bowlinger band and then you buy for the second time. All right, so here you have two trees. You have buy trade one and you have buy trade two. All right, let's continue. But the markets can keep going against us. So we want more trades. This is how these systems work, right? It is again uh just for prop firms. Never run this on private capital. Um but we have here a trade number one, then price falls more. We have trade number two, then price falls more. You have trade number three, price falls more, and then you have your fourth trade. And that one plays out. And the more trades you have, the lot size of each position also changes. So the last trade that banks banks more than the other ones and therefore combined you can close all four positions for profit because the last trade is the biggest one. That's how normally Martin Gills work or great systems. Again be careful with them. We repeat the same process again just copy paste and change some settings. So we're going to just uh we have now two trades and we need let's say eight trades. So it's quite a big uh piece of code. You don't have to build it because we're going to share this very soon. But uh I want you to analyze it, practice it, learn from it, be be active, right? Then you can build hundreds or thousands of these systems yourself. So now we have the the whole piece of code. Um it's the same. You can see by trade two that tree looks exactly the same as the tree next to it and the by trade four, five, six, seven, eight. So this is the whole build. uh within the blocks we have small changes and you can see that if you analyze the blocks when you have the code but uh the difference between let's say buy trade two that tree of blocks and buy trade three that tree of blocks we uh just have to count trades you just count if you already have a position open uh on uh by trade one or two or you don't have uh positions open uh of the other trades because that's the only complex thing here. All right. Then we have management. How to manage this uh algorithm? Well, we have this stream. Select all trades. Check how much profit we have floating. So all the trades combined that we have open. Are we floating combined in profits or loss? If floating profit is enough, something you can of course adjust yourself. If we are in good floating profit, then we want to uh close all the trades and we take our profit and we wait for the next setups. And yeah, this is how you build it. You do it. Select all the trades, a formula to calculate all the the floating profit. So let's say you have five trades open, then you have a a quick formula block there where you count all the the trades combined. And then trade rule. Um so is the profit higher than what I want? Yes. Okay. Then once per trade, close all the trades. And this is how it works. The complexity of this system is in using group numbers. I'm going to explain that real quick. Remember you have that buy trade one. You have the buy trade two. Perhaps you have three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You have a lot of trades, right? What you can do is tag them. So give them a name. Buy trade one has the name group one. By trade two has the name group two. And then you can separate your trades. And that's done within the platform within the blocks. But that's just the only complex thing of this algorithm for if you're totally new to building this, you quickly have to get used to it. We have a lot of templates and we have a big docks also where you can just take a lot of tutorials to learn. But this the complex thingy uh for this strategy. All right. Uh please open the strategy and learn how it works. The link will now be shared by Yoast in this chat. So, Yos, can you share the template link and then you can download it. Of course, this is only available for you guys here online. So, thank you for hopping in and let's cover some questions. Yeah, let's cover some questions. Ask me in the chat here. Let me know. Did you guys like this? Was this beneficial? Was this too advanced? Was this too easy? All right. Yos, thank you for sharing. Really good. Thanks. Perfect. What's the average max draw down of this strategy? All right. Yeah. So, uh if you uh download the strategy, you have inputs and inputs are the settings of your strategy. And there you can adjust the lot size. So, play around with that. Run a back test. See what the floating draw down is. And then if it's too much for you, then just in decrease the size, right? If it's too small, then increase the size. Just play around with it. If you want to have a max risk uh max draw down of 5%. Then you need to decrease the lot size a bit. But if you have for instance uh 10% room then you can maybe trade a little bit more risk. For me, what we personally do with our accounts is to just target half a percent, 1% a month on prop ter firms and then let's say you are 400k funded, you just passively make 4k. But you can also up the risk, but then the probability of losing the account and having big draw down once in the 12 months or in the 24 months or 36 months or whatever. Um it yeah, it all depends on do you want big payouts fast or consistent and long term. That's uh always the the thing, right? All right. Uh this is great. Thank you. Very good topic. Crazy strategy. What's the formula for defining target on each new trade? All right. So, uh good one. I didn't cover that. The first trade I believe has a a small target. And every second trade, uh so if you have one position open and a new one, a new one, a new one, they don't have um targets. And that's because you sum all the floating profit together. So you don't need to target, you just want to stack your positions and when you move into profits uh combined if your profit is uh there like maybe you're floating uh 500 bucks uh maybe that's what you have in the algorithm then everything is closed so you don't need the target. It's just managed every every tick. I hope that answers it. >> Um nice that you explained the strategy in detail before sharing. Yeah. Yeah. We can also build it like really build it in the platform step by step. But I think that will be maybe too overkill but especially with a big project like this but maybe u in the future we can also just not do a keynote and just build that I just built a strategy live with you. You can ask questions and be very uh very nice there. Uh great for further development. Combining it with simple breakout strats from for me makes understanding somewhat more complex strategies easier. Nice. Will there be tutorials on loops and perfect? Maybe in later Thursday meetings for example. We can do advanced uh concepts. I try to get these um try to cover both right to do uh for beginners and advanced traders. uh but we can do uh an advanced topic maybe uh later this year for the the more active builders that have a little bit more experience and loops. Yeah, loops are easy to build in perfect uh you you just uh you don't uh need too many blocks. So I will definitely teach you guys that. Uh what about stacking positive positions? MT Martingale maybe that's it, right? Go test it. go try build it and play around with it. Uh it's an interesting uh idea indeed. Uh we run this on all the mean reversion pairs. So think about a cat for instance. Aussie cat really never move somewhere. Uh just like a kiwi kiwi cat those pairs are the best. And then run this system again on the 15minut time frame and just test for yourself. All right. Thanks for explaining same questions on lot size. Uh you can see that in the settings when you download the system uh you have eight different lot sizes and they stack so you can adjust that see what better results you have but we gave you default settings that already work on rcat for instance but you can play around with it make drone general question I see new cap isn't taking anyone any more members is the course to remain for uh it's we yeah so new cap is a different company than profactus but Um we will launch a uh a big course on uh uh on proactus as well but that is not a main priority now we are building the best platform out there that cannot be all places at once right so if you want to learn YouTube has a lot of tutorials a lot of people know how to build they want to to share that create content if you're an advanced builder right go to YouTube make an account and start sharing uh good content that's uh we also have Enso here he's I Dubai in his background he uh good life he uh is Dutch he has a Dutch community teaching about profactus so more people will uh teach you about building we are just here to to make sure the platform is suitable for everyone and works uh let's see a lot of questions guys uh are your best systems the ones with the most blocks or not necessarily no keep it keep it so simple this is what every also the people that learned building And if I interview them quite quite often like what what have you built? And we of course also built thousands of strategies, simple wins, simple wins. Focus on simple strategies like the amount of blocks I shared today or Yos shared with you today is is just a lot of blocks because you have multiple trades but it has one trade rule, right? Keep it simple. Three trading rules max, maybe five, but don't over complicate it. Bjorn, uh, with imperfectus, it would be great if you can get a tutorial on how to determine the bias for a trade. Example, only enter when an overall higher high is made and execute on a trade when price pulls back to point to fib. Yeah, I have built these type of strategies myself. Uh, I can uh post more of them like these small tutorials in the docs. So, docs.practice.ai, that's also in the builder. You have like a question mark down right. open that and you find a lot of tutorials but I will uh feed that more I will build these tutorials there um simple question is how we can build a tradable range when positions are executed only yeah so it's a little bit too much work to to share that tutorial right now um but I'll ASAP make a tutorial on it it's like for the other people uh listening what if the market is in a trending environment can you tell your algorithm to just trade in that training environment or markets are consolidating can you just ask your system to to to trade in a consolidation market like those are good filters interesting filters I'll share that possible to make a B different uh with different time frames so for example daily time frame bias and 4hour entry yeah so any time frame is possible you can look at the weekly and the daily the 4 hour the one hour and then execute on the one minute if you want um Yeah, all possible. All right. All right. Any more questions? And did you download the system? Because after this call, it's gone. So, make sure you got it. Yeah. But you have the link. So, it will be fine. All right, guys. If there are no more questions, it was already almost a 40inut call. Thank you for being here. Next month, every second Thursday of every month, we host a live webinar and it's always at the same time. So, put it in your calendar and yeah, happy to keep sharing good stuff with you guys. Um, thanks. >> No, this is not the machine you're all right. All right, guys. Thank you and we speak next month. Bye-bye. [Music]",

    "text": "So if you guys have any questions feel free to drop them in the chat. I'm going to move through this whole keynote and then at the end I share a strategy with you as always. I think it will be a very interesting session because we're going to talk about prop firms how to get funding and also my overall journey towards profitable trading and how you can use profactus to reach that. So Profactus AI first of all what is it? What is our mission? Well, simplifying automated trading for everyone is our goal. Why we started this company. But what is Profactus AI? Well, real quick, it's the easy tole learn no code builder to automate any trading strategy allowing everyone to trade FX, crypto, and stocks uh automatically. So, with algorithms, but without having to code. So we built a no coding platform for every trader to just automate your trading plan and then use it in the markets to stay consistent and be consistent while you work out, while you sleep, while you do whatever you want to do during the day, your trades are taken and managed. So I always have this statement, if you were trading for a living tomorrow, you use perfect AI. And what I mean with that is is to figure out, okay, how can you really achieve your goal with trading? And when I started 10 years ago, my goal was to live from this, be independent, be a trader, make money from the markets. And that's why I started learning this skill. And I think if you master Proactors AI, the software platform, then you can reach this goal. And I'm going to dive into that. Why? Let's break it down. The goal, the method, and the metrics, the three steps to take. The goal first is becoming free, independent, making return on your capital, maybe reach financial freedom or whatever it is. That was my goal and I think it's very similar to the goals you guys have. The method is having a profitable strategy and how to know that the strategy is profitable is by testing it and seeing results in the live markets but also seeing results in your back test. So you need a strategy that worked last year the year before that but also that works this year right that is how I define a profitable strategy. So that's the method to reach this goal.",

    "text": "But what are the metrics? And the metrics are often forgotten. And this is where the journey of every trader comes down to executing the strategy perfectly. I can give you the most profitable strategy on earth. But still, because some trades happen while you sleep, some trades happen while you're just not at the charts or you're emotional and you don't execute the trades. Those are all reasons why you're not reaching this goal. So, Pracus AI is built to help you find those profitable strategies, but also execute them without error. And that's the goal of also this call and every call we do every month is to help you find those strategies, build those strategies, test them to see for yourself that they work and then you can reach your goal that you well you started trading for, right? So to go back if you were trading for a living tomorrow you use profactus AI this every time I share this statement just think about the goal the method and the metrics. All right. So, I'm currently uh standing to the right there. You can see that they upgraded the screen. But here you can see I'm standing here on the trading floor and this is the history of this trading floor. And why this is important is because to the left you see a lot of chaos, a lot of people standing here, these desks like this all this wasn't there, right? You can see that a screen didn't exist. And why I'm telling that is because here in Amsterdam uh in the 17th century it all started. uh we in Amsterdam the people living here invented the stock market the first uh company and when that happened also price action was discovered right prices move and therefore technical analysis was used by people here already hundreds of years ago and some people still trade like the same technical analysis from back then right so that was the first invention then the second invention was um the computers existed right market data exploded there were more companies like that first uh stock market company that just went more and more and more companies and therefore there was so much data uh creating a tech revolution",

    "text": "and human beings couldn't really handle it so it had to be automated then we had the next invention and that was PCs this allowed data analysis beyond human capacity this is where the Jim Simons like the the billionaire hedge fund manager that started with automating technical analysis started that During this time when PCs existed or started to uh pop up everywhere, the professionals, the hatchants started to automate what manual traders were doing and this was gamechanging. This literally created billionaires u in our industry in the trading and investing space. Then the next invention was the internet and the internet created market access for everyone. You and me, we're not talking through the internet, right? But also I can access my broker account and every financial market through the internet now by my phone, by my laptop. And this changed everything like even more data, more people could trade, more volume, more liquidity, markets became safer and better uh and easier to to trade. And then right now, where are we currently? Well, you can call this more or less the cloud and the AI um period. You can automate anything. You can test it. You can trade it and you can get funded. And this is uh ridiculous that we are so lucky that we're now able to trade in this time, right? It is never it has never been easier to automate anything, test it if it really works, to trade it, to access the markets, and also how to get funded. Back in the days, it was super hard to uh to get funding and get money to trade with, right? So how I define a modern profitable trader is someone that moved through these five steps. Study the basics of analysis. This can be technical analysis. This can be fundamental analysis. Doesn't really matter. But at least you know the basics of the markets. If you don't, there's so much information online about the basics. What is a pip? What is what is trading? How to buy and sell? How to work with a broker. Right? That's step one. I think most of you guys here are well past that step one. But some of you",

    "text": "guys are stuck at step two and that is the skill of automation. Uh back in the days you had to become a developer, learn to code for many years and then you were able to automate a strategy. Still it took you a lot of time and hours and months or years even to automate one strategy. But now we teach you guys the skill or offer you a platform where you can learn the skill to automate your trading plan without writing any code. So you can build way quicker. you can instead of you having to code a strategy, you can now drag and drop it and you can build well 10 times faster than a developer. So that is step two and then step three is able to back test very quickly. Like I said, uh if you didn't test your strategy, how do you know it works, right? So it's very important to test the strategy because if it worked in the past it's likely to work in the future at least more likely than if you didn't test something or you test something and it is really a bad system then you know it probably won't work in the future right so step three is super important and then four is trades without any errors. How do you do that? Well, automation solves more or less all the problems uh for manual traders. And that's just because yeah, the trade is executed. It's followed by the plan. There are no emotions involved. Yeah. The charts when they move, a trade is taken, right? Uh instead of you having to be stuck to your charts and then has large capital opportunities. This is like that step five that is so important to talk about and that is the topic of today's webinar. So before I continue, any questions guys? All right. So, capital, how to get it and how to keep it. My journey was uh a lot different because it started 10 years ago. So, there weren't prop firms or I didn't no prop firms existed. I don't think there were prop firms 10 years ago. But, so my journey was very uh different compared to what traders have right now. But we also walk the prop firm journey as well. And that is what we're going to talk about. So, method one is using prop firms online. today's topic and in",

    "text": "future webinars maybe I do a a session about how I did it how I got private capital and started to go uh walk that path more or less the old way of doing things. All right so method one using prop firms online is how to get capital real quick for people that don't know what a prop firm is a company that provides capital and resources to skilled traders so they can trade on its behalf in financial markets. So a company invests in you, you trade that company for a profit split. They win, you win, right? That is at least what you think. The skill uh the skill test uh companies give you to to you to prove that you actually can trade, right? The prop firm tests the trader skill by giving a trading challenge. Normally you get a trading account. You need to make 10% uh following a lot of rules. And if you make that 10%, you pass the challenge. And then you have a second challenge and that's the verification where you need to make another 5% or more or less that is the the system most firms offer uh like FTMO like that is one of the biggest one in the world has this skill test. Then what's the business model from their uh their point of view? Well the trader pays the prop firm for that skill test. So to take that skill you need to to pay them a few hundred bucks. And if the trader wins and he proves that he can trade, he passes the 10% and the 5% he gets capital and they refund the money he paid for the skill test. Right? So that's the business model, how it works from a prop firm point of view. The statistics, how does this work in real life? Well, most traders fill the test and a prop firm makes a lot of money because they keep the money that people pay for uh for the skill test, right? The money is used to pay out the select few of traders that actually do pass the skill test and make money. So you have a lot of people losing and uh selection making money. We are one of those people and in this call probably many of you guys have been working with prop firms and got payouts. But that is the business model. You have a lot of losing",

So if you make 10k profits, that money didn't really exist, but they still pay you your profit split. Yeah. All right. So FTMO is the biggest one to prove how much money this industry is making with prop firms is insane. I put in uh from last year August there is the turnover of FTMO. They made 213 million um which is ridiculous. So this is really an industry on its own. But we're going to talk about how to beat them, right? How to how to still be at a good side in this overall plan. So, what I've learned in the building thousands of strategies uh over the past years is you have strategies to pass the skill test. So, the 10% and 5% for instance, you have specifically created strategies to achieve that. And you also have strategies to get payouts, right? So you have two types of strategies to pursue this and you mostly need two strategies. Sometimes you can use the same strategy but I'm not going to share that with you because I want to give you the highest probability to to make money with this. Right. Today we talk about payout strategies. Maybe in a future webinar we're going to talk about uh passing prop firms but right now we're going to talk about how to get the payouts consistently. This will blow your mind to be honest. So take your notes. The most consistently profitable algorithms you see online are the riskiest. Almost everything you see regarding bots and algorithms online are the most risky systems with the best track records and the most consistent results. And I'm going to show you how that works, why that is uh the reason because if you don't know that, you can fall in a trap. And also if you know this, you can use it for prop terms. So, these systems have a very large stop-loss and a very small target. All right? Creating a very",

    "text": "high win rate because it's so easy to hit your target versus your stop-loss. Imagine that you have a huge stop-loss and you have a very tiny target. The market just statistically is more likely to quickly tap your uh target than move all the way down to your stop- loss. Right? That's what I'm trying to say here. and therefore you have very high win rate but your risk-to-reward is negative for the more advanced traders creating profitable results. This strategy creating profitable results month in month out until the market does something crazy and blows up the account. This is probably uh the algorithm that you have seen everywhere online. uh if you ever Googled FX algorithms or whatever algorithm yeah you have seen very steep equity charts and I will show you examples I've seen these systems come and go for the past 10 years so I'm not just telling you I've seen this and it's sort of an obsession for me to see if people trade it on capital to see okay how long will they survive right so have here you create uh you have one that we created this is uh one of those strategies we built um together with my team. You can see it is super consistent, right? Every month of the 14 months is profit. The cumulative return is ridiculous. It is just a straight line, right? All right. So, it looks great indeed. I promise this account will blow up one day. Account gone, everything gone. It will be a minus 100% uh month. And why do I say that to you? Well, this is a risky system to run on private capital. Um but they always do they always explode. This one is now running for 14 months and one day maybe another 14 months will be very good and then it will be bad. Yeah, I will show you um why in a second. So here you have another system. This is not my system. This is a public system. This track record I've been following for many years. It's currently up 11,710% in profits. Yeah. but it blew up but the",

    "text": "owner deposited double the money to save it. So you had a big draw down and then it was margin call and the owner had the money to double the account and saved it and that's what you can see here uh in the big spike right. So also this system blew up but yeah if it's a small account you can just double your money but if you do this on a on a million you better have a million in cash also laying there otherwise the million is gone right so this is how those strategies look and why do I talk about this why do I share this with you guys because yeah it's a little bit of a yeah a weird thing to share right to talk about systems that blow up well what if you can trade these strategies and not worry about blow blowing up. So you can be very consistent month in month out making half a percent 1% maybe more and not worrying about blowing up. Well, this is where prop firms come in because it's not your own capital. It's not even real capital. So if it blows up after x amount of months, you did collect the real money payouts, right? So I will bring this home for people that see this for the first time. I think whoa, what what is this? I'll slowly step by step show it to you. So if we go back to to our track record here, you count 14 profitable months equaling 14 payouts from prop firms, right? When we blow up, I already made good returns. So one of our founders of Profus is also here in the chat and he proved this for almost a year now that since December running this system on FTMO on prop firms and getting payouts, right? And this is what I'm about to teach you today. And also give you a strategy that does this. And then you can test it for yourself. Of course, um you need to test it yourself and play around with it. So of course your own decision, but I just want to show you how to build these type of strategies on proactives AI because a long time ago I made the promise you can automate anything. So also these type of systems. So how the industry names these crazy stupid and risky strategies is normally either martingale grid systems",

    "text": "or sculping systems. Yeah, you have you can really investigate a lot of systems you see online and they probably look like this or that and then they have a big draw down uh floating but they close in profits and they do generate uh consistent returns but one day they blow up but on prop firms it doesn't really matter right because you have more payouts than uh than the probability of losing the account. So far questions. Let me quickly check how that um again never use these on real capital not worth the risk to reward. So for some of you guys you might build uh take the strategy we share today and you uh change it a little bit be creative learn from it and do all of that and then you're thinking like oh maybe I do run it on private capital. Of course, it's your money. Do what with it, whatever. But my disclaimer is pretty clear, right? These strategies are risky but consistent. And um what you will figure out is like if you make a 100% gain because your draw down is 100%. Right? If you know that you might lose your account, you need to have crazy good returns every month to cover that 100%. So therefore, it's not worth the risk to reward. You can calculate it yourself, but it is for prop firms ideal. To follow prop firm rules, it is important that you adjust the strategy. The entries, the exits, everything needs to be adjusted because we are not allowed to all trade the same strategies. Um, so when you start with a strategy like this, when you do trust that you tested it yourself, it's important to adjust it and therefore you need to learn a little bit about how to use perfect AI. So let's dive into that. Let's build a strategy like this step by step and then I share with you the a link the link will be shared here in the Google uh meets later on and then yeah you can just click on it and if you don't have an account sign up and then download it and play around with it adjust it export it and run it. All right. So this is the equity chart uh on a CAD on the 15minut time frame. So 15",

    "text": "and this is what the strategy I'm about to share with you. It's very consistent. It is not the same strategy as this. This is a different strategy but ID is the same and it's also uh well you can test for yourself right. All right trading plan for buys. Let's dive into the trading plan because first we need to know what is this doing step by step and then how to transform the trading plan in building blocks in perfect AI. So we have three u rules here for buy. So what do I need to see the market doing to buy and of course also for sales. What does the market need to show me before I click sell? Of course we are not manually clicking buy and sell. The algorithm will do that. Um, we're living in uh 2025, right? Every 15 minutes, check candle closed is below the bowlinger band low. I will show you a chart example soon. Then check if we don't have trades open, then buy with a lot size, an x amount of lots. If we do have trades open, check how far away we are from this trade and use a different lot size. So it's possible that you take a buy, price goes against you and then you take another buy. So you have two positions open, sometimes you have three positions open, sometimes you have four positions open. Yeah, I'll show you with examples. Then the trading plan for sells is the same but then check uh every 15 minutes check candle closed is above the bowlinger bands high. Super simple strategy. This works on so many strate uh so many different uh simple rules. We have check if we don't have trades open then sell with this lot size and then if we do have trades open check how far away we are from this trade and use a different lot size. Pretty easy trading plan right? All right. How does that look? Well, here we have the algorithm uh opened. When you open a profactive AI algorithm, you can see you can recognize the colors that this created on our platform and you see the bowlinger band, right? So you see uh",

    "text": "more or less a moving channel with three lines. You have the lower line, the midline and the high uh higher line, the top line. Well, the rule for a cell if we go back is check candle closed above the band high. Well, we see that right now. Right now the trade is taken. We have a sell and we have a huge target uh huge stop loss and a very tiny target as I I explained. What happens when p price moves higher? Well, then I want another sell because one day it will do that. So I forwarded it and now you have a sell trade one that's to the left. You have sell trade two to the right. So you were in a sale, price moved against you, you took another sell, and then the the floating profit of both of the systems was positive, and then you close all cell trades. But we're going to dive into that a little bit more now, but this is how the strategy works. You can also see in the middle, I don't know if you can clearly see, but in the middle there was also a buy trade taken. Uh buy trade taken, and it was a quick win. But let's focus on these sell trades now. And well let's buy the uh also do the buy side. So every 15 minutes check candle closed below the bowlinger band low is now transformed to five blocks in profactus AI. We have block number one run pair candle. We have block number two run in session. We have then a trading rule. We have count trades and we have a buy now. These are five blocks you need right now and we're going to build more and more and more. So run per candle. What does that mean? Well, every candlestick close, I want to look at the charts and see if we have a break of that bowlinger band high, right? Or the low. All right. So, the algorithm always starts with run per candle. Then run in session a block is used when to trade. Well, normally you trade almost all the hours because FX is almost 24 hours a day open. So, you want to trade let's say 22 hours um per day. That is what you do here. So every candlestick close",

All right, then check if we don't have trades open then buy with this lot size. What you can see here is count trades. Well, the name already tells you we are counting if we have any trades open. Well, right now we don't have trades open. So that is also valid. And then we have buy now and the trade is executed. You have that that happened here. But then this is a sell example. Um and then this is done. Okay. Now that is just one trade. We have now another tree. And this is a lot of copy paste work. It's just copy paste copy paste. So it's not really getting more complex the more blocks we use. But we have a lot of trades we need to take. So if we have one trade open, if we are far away from that trade one, I want to take trade two if the candle closes again below the bowling band. So that is what we did see here with this example. U again for sales, we had a close above uh that level and then I'm looking to get a sell to uh trade two. Right? So you can see here we have a second tree again run per candle on the 15-minut time frame running in that same session but now we count if we have a buy one trade open. You can just do that select that in the that block itself and then select uh that buy one trade. So select the trade that was already open. Then check how much profits it is running. Is it running 15 pips in profit or is it running uh in a in a loss? How far away is it current price and that all trade because you don't want to enter more trades on the same level, right? You want to see markets far away from that first trade and then trade rule. Well, trade rule is close on the below the bowlinger band and then you buy for the second time. All right, so here you have two trees. You have buy trade one and you have buy trade two. All right, let's",

    "text": "continue. But the markets can keep going against us. So we want more trades. This is how these systems work, right? It is again uh just for prop firms. Never run this on private capital. Um but we have here a trade number one, then price falls more. We have trade number two, then price falls more. You have trade number three, price falls more, and then you have your fourth trade. And that one plays out. And the more trades you have, the lot size of each position also changes. So the last trade that banks banks more than the other ones and therefore combined you can close all four positions for profit because the last trade is the biggest one. That's how normally Martin Gills work or great systems. Again be careful with them. We repeat the same process again just copy paste and change some settings. So we're going to just uh we have now two trades and we need let's say eight trades. So it's quite a big uh piece of code. You don't have to build it because we're going to share this very soon. But uh I want you to analyze it, practice it, learn from it, be be active, right? Then you can build hundreds or thousands of these systems yourself. So now we have the the whole piece of code. Um it's the same. You can see by trade two that tree looks exactly the same as the tree next to it and the by trade four, five, six, seven, eight. So this is the whole build. uh within the blocks we have small changes and you can see that if you analyze the blocks when you have the code but uh the difference between let's say buy trade two that tree of blocks and buy trade three that tree of blocks we uh just have to count trades you just count if you already have a position open uh on uh by trade one or two or you don't have uh positions open uh of the other trades because that's the only complex thing here. All right. Then we have management. How to manage this uh algorithm? Well, we have this stream. Select all trades. Check how much profit we have floating. So all the trades combined that we have open. Are",

    "text": "we floating combined in profits or loss? If floating profit is enough, something you can of course adjust yourself. If we are in good floating profit, then we want to uh close all the trades and we take our profit and we wait for the next setups. And yeah, this is how you build it. You do it. Select all the trades, a formula to calculate all the the floating profit. So let's say you have five trades open, then you have a a quick formula block there where you count all the the trades combined. And then trade rule. Um so is the profit higher than what I want? Yes. Okay. Then once per trade, close all the trades. And this is how it works. The complexity of this system is in using group numbers. I'm going to explain that real quick. Remember you have that buy trade one. You have the buy trade two. Perhaps you have three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You have a lot of trades, right? What you can do is tag them. So give them a name. Buy trade one has the name group one. By trade two has the name group two. And then you can separate your trades. And that's done within the platform within the blocks. But that's just the only complex thing of this algorithm for if you're totally new to building this, you quickly have to get used to it. We have a lot of templates and we have a big docks also where you can just take a lot of tutorials to learn. But this the complex thingy uh for this strategy. All right. Uh please open the strategy and learn how it works. The link will now be shared by Yoast in this chat. So, Yos, can you share the template link and then you can download it. Of course, this is only available for you guys here online. So, thank you for hopping in and let's cover some questions. Yeah, let's cover some questions. Ask me in the chat here. Let me know. Did you guys like this? Was this beneficial? Was this too advanced? Was this too easy? All right. Yos, thank you for sharing. Really good. Thanks. Perfect. What's the",

    "text": "average max draw down of this strategy? All right. Yeah. So, uh if you uh download the strategy, you have inputs and inputs are the settings of your strategy. And there you can adjust the lot size. So, play around with that. Run a back test. See what the floating draw down is. And then if it's too much for you, then just in decrease the size, right? If it's too small, then increase the size. Just play around with it. If you want to have a max risk uh max draw down of 5%. Then you need to decrease the lot size a bit. But if you have for instance uh 10% room then you can maybe trade a little bit more risk. For me, what we personally do with our accounts is to just target half a percent, 1% a month on prop ter firms and then let's say you are 400k funded, you just passively make 4k. But you can also up the risk, but then the probability of losing the account and having big draw down once in the 12 months or in the 24 months or 36 months or whatever. Um it yeah, it all depends on do you want big payouts fast or consistent and long term. That's uh always the the thing, right? All right. Uh this is great. Thank you. Very good topic. Crazy strategy. What's the formula for defining target on each new trade? All right. So, uh good one. I didn't cover that. The first trade I believe has a a small target. And every second trade, uh so if you have one position open and a new one, a new one, a new one, they don't have um targets. And that's because you sum all the floating profit together. So you don't need to target, you just want to stack your positions and when you move into profits uh combined if your profit is uh there like maybe you're floating uh 500 bucks uh maybe that's what you have in the algorithm then everything is closed so you don't need the target. It's just managed every every tick. I hope that answers it. >> Um nice that you explained the strategy in detail before sharing. Yeah. Yeah. We can also build it like really build it in the platform step by step. But I",

    "text": "think that will be maybe too overkill but especially with a big project like this but maybe u in the future we can also just not do a keynote and just build that I just built a strategy live with you. You can ask questions and be very uh very nice there. Uh great for further development. Combining it with simple breakout strats from for me makes understanding somewhat more complex strategies easier. Nice. Will there be tutorials on loops and perfect? Maybe in later Thursday meetings for example. We can do advanced uh concepts. I try to get these um try to cover both right to do uh for beginners and advanced traders. uh but we can do uh an advanced topic maybe uh later this year for the the more active builders that have a little bit more experience and loops. Yeah, loops are easy to build in perfect uh you you just uh you don't uh need too many blocks. So I will definitely teach you guys that. Uh what about stacking positive positions? MT Martingale maybe that's it, right? Go test it. go try build it and play around with it. Uh it's an interesting uh idea indeed. Uh we run this on all the mean reversion pairs.

Uh you can see that in the settings when you download the system uh you have eight different lot sizes and they stack so you can adjust that see what better results you have but we gave you default settings that already work on rcat for instance but you can play around with it make drone general question I see new cap isn't taking anyone any more members is the course to remain for uh it's we yeah so new cap is a",

And we of course also built thousands of strategies, simple wins, simple wins. Focus on simple strategies like the amount of blocks I shared today or Yos shared with you today is is just a lot of blocks because you have multiple trades but it has one trade rule, right? Keep it simple. Three trading rules max, maybe five, but don't over complicate it. Bjorn, uh, with imperfectus, it would be great if you can get a tutorial on how to determine the bias for a trade. Example, only enter when an overall higher high is made and execute on a trade when price pulls back to point to fib. Yeah, I have built these type of strategies myself. Uh, I can uh post more of them like these small tutorials in the docs. So, docs.practice.ai, that's also in the builder. You have like a question mark down right. open that and you find a lot of tutorials but I will uh feed that more I will build",

    "text": "these tutorials there um simple question is how we can build a tradable range when positions are executed only yeah so it's a little bit too much work to to share that tutorial right now um but I'll ASAP make a tutorial on it it's like for the other people uh listening what if the market is in a trending environment can you tell your algorithm to just trade in that training environment or markets are consolidating can you just ask your system to to to trade in a consolidation market like those are good filters interesting filters I'll share that possible to make a B different uh with different time frames so for example daily time frame bias and 4hour entry yeah so any time frame is possible you can look at the weekly and the daily the 4 hour the one hour and then execute on the one minute if you want um Yeah, all possible. All right. All right. Any more questions? And did you download the system? Because after this call, it's gone. So, make sure you got it. Yeah. But you have the link. So, it will be fine.

    "text": "All right, let's get started. Build better algorithms faster. That is what I'm going to talk about today. It's a very important topic because a lot of people want to build their strategy, want to automate their trading strategy, but they don't know what is a good trading plan, how do I test this trading plan, how do I optimize it, and what is the best way of doing this. So I thought okay, what did I do the last 10 years? How did I find my trading strategies? I'll give a profitable strategy to you at the end of the session obviously but also talking about the process is more important I think the outcome because if you know how to take these nine steps I'm about to show you then you can do it for yourself you don't need me you don't need anyone else you don't need a mentor anymore you just need to follow those nine steps and that's what I figured out over 10 years and collected in this keynote so let's get started build better algorithms faster is the topic first for the new ones what is Prractice AI. It's the easy tole learn no code builder to automate any trading strategy. If you're trading supply demand, superb resistance, chart patterns, um ICT, SMC concepts, uh whatever you trade, uh you can automate it with profactus. You just need to learn the skill of automation and building it allowing everyone to trade FX, crypto and stock market automatically. So the algorithms run on Metatrader 5 uh which is connected to many many brokers worldwide which allow you to trade FX crypto and stocks. Therefore you can use our algorithms that you build on Prus AI uh across all markets which is very beneficial. I really love that. I like to trade all the markets. Let me tell you why changes the industry a little bit about the story and a little bit about a major problem that is happening in the trading industry that cost a lot of people returns. first, what does every great trader have? That was the first thing I had to solve. Like, okay, there are good traders, there are bad traders, there are uh people that really put in a lot of effort and there are people putting less effort and maybe even getting better returns. So, it was for me really a roller coaster of figuring out what does a great trader have and if you know that, if you define that, you can make a plan to become one, right? So what does every great trader have first of all is a profitable trading strategy. That is one of the two things every great trader has. How you build that, how you find that, how to get it is all covered in today's keynote. But first, what is the second point? Yes, perfect execution of this strategy. So profitable trading strategy is step one and then perfect execution of the strategy is step two. And some people have very good strategies but cannot um really execute them perfectly due to their emotions or due to their routine, their work, their life, just everything that's going on. And others have that great routine. They have the time to sit behind the charts, but then they probably don't have a profitable trading strategy. So, it's extremely important that you have both. 90% of the traders lose and this is in my opinion really because they don't have both. And we're going to solve that. So you guys will be profitable if you aren't already. And if you are profitable, maybe you want to automate and uh or you want to add another strategy because with automation, you can of course trade manually and also add algorithms to your same account and then boost your performance by using multiple strategies. So it's for everyone. If you're a manual trader or an algo trader, more strategies is almost always better. So you can have a profitable strategy and still lose. How does this happen? Let me quickly cover it for you. If we see a chart here, random strategy, um you see three different positions. A 5% gain, another 5% gain, and a minus 1% loss. So every trade you take, if target is reached, you win five times more than when you're wrong. So if you're wrong, minus 1%, if you're right, plus 5%. These three trades are from a profitable strategy. If you now zoom in and really look at the time statements. The problem here is I sleep at two at night and at three at night as well, right? I I just go to bed, I sleep, and it's almost impossible or it's not really a good life if you have to be up 24 hours uh to watch the charts and it's very stressful and the lack of sleep will also make you less sharp. You will miss more and it is like a roller coaster. So, what you can see here is you miss the first two trades and then you're awake and you take that third trade. And this is when someone has a profitable strategy but misses a lot of setups. And that's a big problem. Your profitable strategy is now 9% up, but you're down 1%. And what normally happens after this strong winning streak of 9% is you probably your strategy hits a normal losing streak and uh maybe loses a few more trades. That first strategy or your overall strategy is now still in good profits but you are down very badly maybe even losing a funding account or something like that. And that is what we try to solve here. You can also have a perfect routine and also lose. So here you have four trades and this is very common. A lot of people in the industry um back test like a month or maybe two months of price action. They see four trading setups. They took these four trading setups and they think this is the holy grail trading strategy. But what they don't know is the following. You think the strategy is profitable when it is not. And this is very dangerous, maybe even more dangerous than that profitable trading strategy when the routine is not that great because what you execute at least has an edge. If you increase your sample size now, the strategy stops working. And that looks like this. If you zoom out, add more data. So if you back test your strategy on one month, so you look back in time, I did have five setups and then that is profitable. You might assume, okay, this works. But if you then test six months or a year or five years or 10 years, then you really have the big picture, you zoomed out and you really see, all right, my strategy just worked for a short period of time. And this is very dangerous. And if you have one of these two problems, you will never make it. You'll just hop from strategy to strategy. And you need to solve this. You cannot become profitable without both. That that's the big statement here. And let me now define okay what to do with this information. Profitable trading strategy perfect execution is what you need. How do you get a profitable trading strategy? You back test it. So look back in time. How many times did your setup occur? And then you live life test it. What I normally do my best practice is I back test my strategy over 10 years of data. So it happened hundreds and hundreds of times in the past. Then I build the case. Okay, it will probably work in the future. Then I take a small trading account. So small is of course relative but I would really uh recommend everyone to just take a very small live account or a demo account and then run it on the live markets and then compare the results from your back test with live performance and then really confirm it. Build some more confidence. See how your algorithm performs live and then you build that track record and you get more confidence. Now you see okay it's actually making me money and then you can scale up accordingly. That's what my process is. That has been my process and we literally follow that process with millions under management. Right? So that is a pretty good way of doing things in my opinion. Then step two, perfect execution of the strategy. What do you need? It needs to be emotionless and you always need to be at the charts, right? Because if you sleep, you miss setups. So your algorithm needs to always run. If you have these two things, you are profitable. That's it's that easy. All right, let's dive into more examples. Let's define now or answer better yet this question. How to become a great trader. Have a back tested and live tested profitable strategy that is executed always without emotions or errors. That is in one statement. If someone asked me how did you become profitable this would be my answer and now we defined everything in one sentence which makes it easier to achieve this goal when I figured this out everything changed for me so I want to talk a little bit about my routine um but also about my journey because I think there are a lot of nuggets in this I won't do it that much because in much detail um because yeah we are here to also learn but I think it's important to share a little more about myself, what helped me to become profitable. So you can learn from that. Also, I did some podcasts that will drop soon about my story. So you if you ever are interested in learning more about it, you can do that and listen to that. I will share that in the profactive channel when that happens. So my story and how it helps you. I have some bullet points here. I started 10 years ago. I traded more or less one to two years without a clear trading plan. So maybe you are currently in that situation. you uh are watching the news analyzing uh maybe stocks or uh currencies or whatever you're analyzing but you don't really have a clear defined plan. I did that for one to two years and I was all over the place. News came into the markets. I traded the news and then I was like okay how do I enter? Well, what momentum is there and I didn't really define a clear plan. Then I realized I have to join a trading community. So Perfect AI is not an educational company. It's just a software platform that helps you automate. Um, but for me back then, I joined the trading community and really studied their trading strategy, their style, their uh strategy, uh their routine, what I had to do to get the same results as that other person. Then I figured out extreme hard work for bad returns. I put in the work. I learned a lot and I'm grateful for that period. But the returns weren't there. put in more and more and more hard work and then I improved uh the returns and they become decent they became uh became decent for um maybe you make 20 30 40 R a year so 20 to 40% if you risk 1% uh per per trade and from there I moved okay how can I improve this trading plan because the problem I had was it was very subjective in that trading community there were a a lot of traders and everyone traded a different trading plan and they all adjusted it and some your mentor took a trade and then I missed the trade and it was like was this officially a trade? There were so many questions and then I was like okay I need to become independent. I need to take a step back, take all the information I have and write down a new plan for me that works for me that I can test that I have the data on and that I I don't need anyone else. I can just focus on this. And that was a great great thing I decided to do. I improved the trading plan by manually back testing. So that is literally I remember the December months from back then that I was just sitting in my room just writing uh the trade setups down in an Excel sheet or in my notebook. And from there um a trading plan was made based on supply and demand. Details don't matter but that trading plan worked and that helped me to raise my uh six figures in funding and private capital. This was back in 2018. Then quit my job and I started to live in France. Then I moved to Ebiza for a few months. So that whole 2019 I was gone and that was a great time but also a little bit stressful because I was still trading that manual style. It was very mechanical and profitable so it made life easier but still had to check check the markets every four hours and and yeah we didn't have that many trading setups. I wanted more returns. So I came back to the Netherlands and then we were looking to hire someone and I discovered automation and from that moment we started to automate within my team. We started to automate any trading strategy and also keep trading manually. And right now um back then it was like we have one automated trading strategy and our manual trading strategy. And now we have like tons of uh automated strategies and still that manual trading strategy. But that manual trading strategy is mostly outperformed by 80% of the algorithms. So if I stop trading that manual trading style, I still make returns. Most of my returns are automated. So trading both is doable. When that one strategy I trade manually stops working, I'll just never trade manual again because why should you, right? If you can also do it automatically without the stress needed. that helped me raise eight figures in funding and private capital and I co-founded Profactors AI to help others access the hedge style of trading. The hedgeon style of trading means that you base everything on data. You automate everything and it's not anymore based on just your subjective opinion. That doesn't work anymore. Algorithms are faster, better and yeah this is in a nutshell my journey. If you uh take all of this, summarize or put it together, I created the workflow, the nine um let's see uh let's see the nine step blueprint to uh become a great trader. That's what I did. And taking that will uh change the game for everyone. This blueprint just helps you step by step what I still do to this day. But people do this uh in until the end of time I think because this is what helps us generate great returns and you can use this blueprint for yourself these nine steps with any trading strategy. So let's start. The first step is finding the right ID to trade. And this is where a lot of people get scared because what are IDs? Can I find a good ID? What makes a good ID? Um, I'm new to trading. I don't know what an ID is, right? This is very important to understand. And I'll show you how to solve this step one. Every strategy starts with an ID. It could come from a trading community like I had with that first strategy, a research paper, a blog post of your own observation. Maybe you have been sitting behind the charts a lot and you see patterns. You can also just uh look at YouTube, type in trading strategy and you see trading strategies. Believe me, there are millions of them. You can test endlessly. So don't be scared about finding that right trading ID. They are everywhere, but most IDs are not good. But Profactus AI helps you to automate them quickly and just check off all the IDs you see. Let's say you built 100 algorithms this month, then you will definitely find some profitable strategies and you're good to go and you'll have something that works. It's that easy. Let's now formulate the trading idea. The thesis I have is I think that strong price breakouts happen after a period of consolidation or ranging markets. I want to test this. That might be your thought process right now or something you have in your mind. this thesis is not complete yet and what you the first skill you need to develop is to how can I get that idea in my mind to something that I can test and that process that flow you need to train and that costs a few minutes but you need to know how I do it so I think that strong price breakouts happen after period of consolidation I want to test this that's the thesis let's improve this thesis I'm taking one of the global trading sessions and check if price consolidated. If so, I take the breakout trade afterwards. You can make the argument that these two statements are the same. But what I changed is being a little bit more specific. Instead of saying uh just consolidation and ranging, now I defined a range as a global trading session. So that's the range I'm looking at. So the London session, Asian session, New York session. Um that is what I'm looking at. And then I check if price consolidated. And then I take the breakout trade. Now let's improve it a little bit more. I I will trade the Asian session breakout after yesterday candlestick closed as a dogee pattern. Dogey pattern. If you don't know what it is, go to Google chart patterns and you will have a big list of uh I will show you in this keynote um what it is. But a dogee is just price didn't really move for that last candlestick. It was just you have the high, you have the low and somewhere in the middle you have the body and the close uh the body with the open and the close price. So price didn't really move. If price didn't really move then I define it as consolidation or ranging. Right? The session started and end of the session or end of the day we are still at the same place. Then step two turn the ID in trading blocks. Now we know what we want to look for an Asian breakout with yesterday being a dogey pattern. And then we can build on top of this strategy which we will do in this uh keynote. Turn the ID into trading blocks. Every ID needs an entry, a stop-loss and a target. If we have this, we can create a strategy within proactive AI. If you don't know where to enter, how to take a trade. If you don't have a stop loss, it's way too risky. Always have a stop and you need a target. If you have those things, you can back test it over 10 or 20 years of data. Then at the end of the Asian session, I check if yesterday's scandal closes as a dogey. If so, I will go to the 1 hour time frame and place a buy order at the range high with a stop loss at range low. This is now the trading plan I can build. If we go back, you can see here uh I think that strong price breakouts happen. I have a consolidation. I want to test this. Now, I transformed that to a trading plan. This is a skill you need to practice. And if you have a trading plan in mind or an ID in your mind, slowly write out what the ID actually is and find an entry, a stop loss, and a target. If you do that, you're very close to being able to automate it already. And what the best stop loss is, what the best target is, what your trade management is, doesn't matter. That comes later. I'll show you how to find the best settings for your strategy. You just need to have the raw ID turned into trading blocks. Here you can see there are so many chart patterns and candlesticks you can automate. Uh it's a huge list. There are billions of things you can do. All right. In perfect CI we have four blocks with this trading algorithm. Super simple. First of all run at time algorithm checks the market at 6:00 in the morning. Some of you guys might already recognize this algorithm. We'll talk about how to improve it and uh some new nuggets. But run time algorithm checks the market at 6:00 in the morning. The run at time block is very important because you need to see it as a manual trader. You wake up at 6:00 in the morning. You one time just look at the charts what is happening right now and then based on that you go through your trading rules and you place a buy order or not. That's what you do, right? Then the second thing is trade rule block. Trade rule block is yesterday is a dogey pattern. If yesterday is a dogey pattern then um if that is correct all right we go to the next block and that's how perfecti works we count the trades don't have any orders placed yet or no trades uh open that's what you do within this count trades block and from there the last block is of course your buy order place the order at the 1 hour high with a stop loss and a target four blocks it takes me I think 15 30 seconds to build this algorithm. If you're new, it will be a few minutes. But the fun thing of building with perfectis AI is at first it is overwhelming. It's a little bit of work and trying to get that skill level and then you become quicker quicker and quicker and then you can imagine how we build hundreds of algorithms a month. Right? Then at trade management use the break even trail template. We have within profctus we have trade management tra templates and strategy templates can just with one click you can add for instance how to trail your stop loss to break even it will be added to your algorithm you can play around with it I did that but yeah you'll get the file later in this keynote then step three you now had an ID you build it in profactus and we'll look at the code later on and now step three is use visual mode in metatrader 5 why do I do is well I want to see what the algorithm is actually doing if there are no errors if everything is exactly like I expect it to behave. Now to do this you go to X5 export you export the algorithm to your PC and you upload the algorithm to MT5 Metatrader 5. If you don't know how this works then go to docs.profractice.ai AI for free tutorials on how to install MetaTrader 5 for Mac or for for Windows or use a server and how to import into MetaTrader 5. It's just copy paste. But if you need some more guidance, you can just go to docs.practice.ai and we'll help you out with the tutorials there. If you open Metatrader 5, it will look like this. You can see expert symbol, date, forward, like a whole list of things. You open the algorithm and you can see the symbol is dollar yen. The time frame is daily. Within the code, I already made it like it will adjust pair time frame. So you can choose daily, 15 minute, 1 hour, doesn't really matter and the algorithm will take the same trades. But sometimes if you can run your algorithm on a lower time frame and then trades change based on your logic. For now, just run it on the daily or the 1 hour and you're good to go. Then what is important? Deposit 100k. Um and then you have optimization that's disabled. More on that later. And then you have here visual mode. If you select that a chart will pop up and you'll see a beautiful chart when your where your algorithm is taking trades. How that looks is like this. Here you have a dollar yen running. We have a buy trade a 5.7 lots long with a stop loss nicely placed lower. And then we have a target with a nice risky wart. So this is a a big risk. What you can see is the day before this entry. So one candlestick before you can see hopefully it's clear. You see a small body and a bigger wick. That's that dogey pattern. And then the high breaks and you go long here on the 1 hour. You can see this trade. I made uh 4,200. And you can see here on the 1 hour chart how the trade was executed. Price just triggered the order and price went flying and then the trade was closed automatically. You can also have a a management style there. Maybe no target and then trailing your stop loss. That's something I like to do. Have a big target and a nice uh trailing stop-loss. But after this video, you you know how to test all of this. Next up, step four. Use Metatrader 5 to test all assets quickly. If you find an ID online and this happens a lot, you find an ID on YouTube and someone tells you, \"Okay, this is uh this is the pound dollar trading strategy that will make you rich, right?\" What you need to do is to automate the strategy, follow these steps, but then also, you don't really know if pound dollar is really the best pair to trade because that guy, believe me, that made that video didn't back test all assets. Uh otherwise, he automated maybe then he did it. But if you want to manually back test a trading strategy over 5 to 10 years of data on all assets, you don't have a life. Like that is extreme hard work. Uh and that's normally not what happens. So therefore my step four is always test all assets quickly. Let let the algorithm show me does this work really very well on pound dollar or is dollar yen better or Aussie yen or uh BTC. I always use this step for how does this work? You can do this all automatically. First market watch. This is your list of um symbols assets in your Metatrader. A yen, euro yen, pound yen, ky yen, dollar yen is what I have here. Of course, in your MetaTrader 5, you probably have the list with everything and that's fine. Then you test your algorithm on everything at once. That will be cool. Let me show you how that works. For this example, I just have a few just the GPY pairs, but that's just for this example. Uh on my normal setup, I also have all of them from RCAT to uh to Kiwi pairs and then also Ethereum, BTC, S&P 500, US30, US 500. Like you can just go down the list. All right. What's important? Test all symbols in market watch. We are back here at strategy tester in Metatrader. Now we select optimization at the bottom and we select all symbols. selected in market watch. If you do that, you can see that I tested this algorithm and you have five different algorithms. Dollar yen, AEN, euren, QEN, pound yen and they all took 200 to 300 trades based on the time period I selected. And you can clearly see the most profits under 28,000 is on dollar yen. So this is the best pair, right? And then the worst pair with these particular settings is pound yen. This doesn't mean that you cannot make this profitable on pound genen, but with this current risk to reward and this trade management and exactly these settings of the strategy, dollar yen is the best outcome. For me, this is super important because it let it lets me skip like all the extra work. It lets me just focus on okay, what works already with this raw trading ID. And it's super important. It really speeds up like okay, it works here. And then you can see here the best pair you have 1.72 that's profit factor that's the higher the profit factor normally the better the returns but always also look at the max draw down and then we have the return so dollar yen is definitely the best here then step five use metatrader 5 to test the best asset fully now we know that dollar yen is the best one what do I want to now solve well what is the best risk reward when to trail my stop-loss and maybe a thousand other things I want to test, right? Maybe to scale into my positions or test different management styles instead of uh going to break even at one uh percent of profit floating. Maybe I want to uh have a trading stop loss, a big bigger target, maybe something else. You have a lot of questions now like oh what can I test? Let's focus on this first. Strategy tester again symbol dollar yen slow complete algorithm is what you now select. This means that you optimize just dollar yen not anymore all market watch now you're just specifically focused on dollar yen. Click on uh slow complete algorithm and then you'll go to inputs and if you go to inputs also in your metat trader you can see floating profits and target floating profits uh you see start is one step is 0.5 and stop is two. What does start step and stop mean real fast for new people is start is the first test you run. Then after that test is complete you take a step. So you add 0.5 on top of that start amount. So that's 1.5. And then you run that back test. Uh and then another step is 0.5 plus 1.5 is two. And then it stops because you need to end the test some uh sometime. To the right you can see steps. Those are three. This just means I'm testing three settings. Then target. That's my risk-to-reward. My target is 100% of my stop-loss size. You can see I start at 300. So that's a one to three risk-to-reward. My target is three times my stop loss size. And then step is 100. So one R or 1% extra on profits. And then stop is uh 1,000. So that's a 1 to 10 risk reward. So we what we are testing here is uh 1 to three risk reward, 1 to 4, 1 to 5, 1 to 6, 7, 8, and 1 to 9 and 1 to 10. But at the same time, we also are testing when to trail our stop loss. So they are multiplied three and eight is 24 different back tests. You click on start, go to sleep, you wake up and you have the answer. I did this answer for you already. Now you have this big list. What is this big list? Well, these are all the back test returns of all the settings we just tested. Floating profits uh and the target and a combination of that. The best settings are shown here. Floating profits at two R in profits. So I'm floating I'm taking a buy. I'm floating 2% in profits. Um then I trail my stop loss to break even and then I have a target of one to three. That is uh apparently based on this um the best setting. All right. Then if you doubleclick on this best setting a single uh test will start with those settings and then you have a back test report. You can analyze your equity curve and you can play uh with that and yeah you're more or less done. Then step six, analyze the returns, decide if this is worth more time. Sometimes you follow this process and then this list is not that good. This list might be less profitable, big draw down and then you just had a bad idea. And therefore, it's super important that you don't marry your ID. Don't marry your strategy. I'm a trader. All I care about is making money with my trading strategy. And a lot of people spend a lot of time on a bad strategy. They marry their idea is how I call it. They already spend months on it and now they want to make it work. But for me, what helped a lot is analyze the returns and decide if this worth your time. If this ends up to be bad, which happens also, then move on. Find a different ID. And like I said, we have hundreds or even millions of IDs. Hundreds of them are in the Discord channel anyways. So you can start there if you don't have any IDs, but I think you guys will have a lot of IDs. Just look for it. Then step seven, document your process and what you tested. This super important. Just write down somewhere in your notes. Okay, I tested this strategy, this ID, this thesis. Now you know that because five years from now, you might forget about it and then you might build the same algorithm again. That's not uh not wise to do. So document this process and then you have a profitable strategy. Now I will share it soon with you. Run the strategy live on a small account and use this track record and strategy to scale up. Run this live for depending on the strategy you trade because if you have every day a trade after a few weeks you might be confident enough to risk a little bit more have a bigger account. But if you only have one trade a week then of course it will take a few months to build that confidence. So if you have a day trading strategy, you can quicker go live probably than if you have a swing trading strategy because you want to see some trades. You build a track record and uh yeah and that strategy and you scale up. Yos, can you share the the link so they can download the code? If you guys have questions, let me know. Yos shared in the in the chat. So you can click there and download the strategy. What I want to do is walk you through this strategy real quick uh while you download it uh and explain what is going on here. So the strategy itself is rather simple. We have uh two parts. We have this part here, the left side and the right side. And this is the perfectus AI canvas. We have run time. That was the first thing I explained to you. We have server time, local time in back testing. It doesn't really make a difference life. It does. uh once per day at 6:00 in the morning. Why do I use 6:00 in the morning? Well, that is you can check that with your broker and just open your visual mode. You now know how it works. Just see if your algorithm really runs at the right time based on your time settings. Uh to solve that, just open visual mode and look at the first trade at stake and then see if the times are correct. But for me, 6:00 in the morning means um the Asian session has been going on for about 6 hours. So at 6:00 in the morning, I look back at those six hours to just analyze what's what happened. Um do we have a high, a low and all that? Then the trade rule is simple. This is a dogee pattern, which means that the candle body size. So that's the small part uh of the dogee, the open and close price that form the body is smaller than the total size of the whole candle. And that's including the wick. So you have an upper wick and a lower wick. And I multiply that by 0.25. 25. If you really want to have very small bodies with big wigs, you can also change this to uh 0.1. Um, but I kept it on 0.25. I recommend you to test multiple things. And this is just a dogey pattern. Maybe you want to build this algorithm not based on consolidation, but just trade the Asian breakout when momentum happens. So if you have instead of this trading rule checking this maybe you want to check okay yesterday was an engulfing pattern or it was um some some other chart pattern and then I want to take the breakout. You can play around with it. What's important is I set this to the daily time frame. So this block just tracks the candlesticks on the daily time frame. Then I count if I don't have uh or I count if I have less than two trades open. You can also change this, but I have just two trades. And then order count is zero. I don't have an order placed yet. And then buy pending order. You open price. This is a little bit complex, but uh here you select market properties. Then you select C or you select custom price, then market properties, then highest price candle period. And we are looking back at 6:00 in the morning. And then we look back six candles. All right. So candle five in the morning, four in the morning, three, two, one, zero. Um, just the first one hour candles of the new uh day. Then you do start candle one to six price value and you're good to go. Advanced options, select the 1 hour time frame here, right? Because if you keep this on the daily, then you're looking back six days and selecting the highest price to place your order. That's not what we defined in our trading room. So make sure you select the 1 hour. can also keep it on current but then you need to go to your MetaTrader five and run this strategy on the one hour time frame. The money management just simple risk balance 1% risk per trade. Then the stop loss is placed um at the custom price level. So it's a price level and that's the lowest price of the range. So we now have the lowest price. Again, use the 1 hour time frame. Otherwise, you will place a huge stop-loss on the daily time frame and take profit. We have here percent of stop-loss. I change this instead of a number, I change this to an input. So, I can change it within inputs and variables. Uh, but also in my MetaTrader, those settings I optimized, right? So, default to set at 300. Um, but I can change it. So therefore I went to inputs I clicked on plus typed into target and then 300 and then I added that here by just typing it will pop up here. Select it and now I can adjust it. What is next? Order expiration. I need to delete my order at at least 9 in uh evening. If I don't do it, the order will just be there forever and then until it gets triggered. But if Christ never comes back, it will be just chilling there uh for way too long. I don't want that. delete your order if it's not triggered and you can do that here. Then I went to templates and I added break even trail. So you just select that apply template and then these four blocks opened. I select all the trades and sells a trade source. You can use that. You can do manual and automated trades but I just do automated trades only. Check floating profits uh here at uh one. So of course it's important to have floating profits there. Optimize it and stop loss to break even happens here. Percent of stop loss to minus 1%. And that's it guys. That is the strategy. If uh check floating profit if this was not selected here, make sure you do it. But um yeah, besides that, this is all you need to know. Let me know. Let's do some questions. Happy to help you out. Uh it's a good time to catch up. Let's do that right now. Let me know in the in the chat uh if you have any questions how to find the right time settings. So this is um um based on your logic. If you want to trade the London uh session, you just need to to open your charts on MetaTrader where you run your algorithm and go through the charts quickly with your cursor and see what time it is and then just use those times in in perfect AI and then run your algorithm. If you figure out the algorithm is taking trades at different times, then change the settings and find the right ones. We have a time schedule on plan perfect improvements. Yes. So we are busy with a lot of new features. Um some of you guys want advanced math. Um you can do a lot in the formula blocks but there are some things that are not there like a square root. If that's there I think you can build any indicator possible. Right now you can build almost all of them but um that will be added. uh volume indicator if um yeah we will add that a lot of indicators will be added but I prefer to teach you guys also or share with you guys how you can build them yourselves because then you become limitless right um because maybe you want every week a new indicator and then we have to add it but if you know how to use the formula block properly then you can just build any indicator yourself so we're trying to solve that problem to you. Yeah, just give you that superpower that you can just automate any indicator yourself. You just need to understand how it works. But nowadays with chat, you just ask what is the formula of this indicator and then you build it in the formula blocks. So we are trying to find the sweet spot there. What would you recommend in terms of strategy selection when trying to build the best poss? For example, if I already have five breakout strategies, should I continue developing more breakout systems? If breakout strategies work for you, I would recommend to stick to that breakout strategies at least for FX markets and crypto work very well. Um, if you manage those breakout strategies differently and you also enter them on different time frames, you can build a very diversified portfolio based on breakouts. And that's something I discovered myself as well. If FX is not breaking out, go to crypto because there's a very interesting balance. When FX doesn't move, so the forex market is not moving for a few weeks uh for big breakouts, then maybe your performance is slacking a little bit in your portfolio, but then crypto is moving. Crypto doesn't move, stocks are moving, but money is always moving somewhere. It's very rare that like all markets are very quiet. maybe during Christmas but uh even in Christmas due to low liquidity you have big moves and big moves are required for your breakout strategies. So do management diversification. So that means manage your trades differently uh sometimes tight management in maybe uh markets that don't break out that much but also have strategies with slower management that you can catch those big waves. If you do that you build a good portfolio in my opinion. Hope that helps. Yes. Yeah, we can add that. Any more questions? Do you guys use multiple breakout strategies on one pair? For example, Asian uh range breakouts, London, New York. Yes. Yeah, we have multiple different breakout strategies on uh similar pairs. Yeah. Yeah. any preferred brokers? No. So, indeed, you need to find a good broker. Um, we don't have a broker deal or anything like that. Um, but yeah, if you can trade your FX uh strategies at the same broker, that would be perfect. What we do is literally just where we trade FX also trade um crypto. But of course in your forward test you will figure out if your broker is good or not. And forward test is that live small account test you run on your broker and then you collect data very quickly. If you see after 10 trades and you back test those 10 trades then uh then you see okay it works or it doesn't. Uh I see mainly swing trading strategies. Do tra day trading strategies work less optimal? Sculping strategies? Yeah, go for swing trading strategies. A lot of people always say I want a sculper. I want to have a quick strategy. But the problem of that is I haven't in 10 years I haven't seen a good sculping strategy uh that performed over a long period of time. And the argument a lot of people make with swing trading is ah it is slow. I don't have many trades. just build more strategies. I can build a portfolio that takes five or 10 swing trades a day, right? If you just build more swing strategies, you'll you'll have more trades. So, yeah, sculping is uh less optimal based on our experience over the over the many years doing this. You can make it work. We do have like some shorter term strategies working on crypto breakout strategies, but optimizations on multiple pairs in one test in Metatrader 5. Is that possible? Like no, that's not possible. Also something uh we are trying to solve that you can uh optimize individually on everything together. If that makes sense. What I showed you in this keynote is how to test one setting on all pairs. And I test and I showed you how to test all settings on one pair. But testing all settings on all pairs in one go is not possible. But I think we can build it in a year. How long do you recommend my track record should be before I start approaching investors to raise private capital? I would do three to six months. If you really follow this process I just showed you, you have a back test of 10 plus years of your strategy working. Those are hundreds or even thousands of trades. That's a lot of confidence you have, right? If you then have a a live performance of just a few months, really compare that live performance with your back test. And if that is the same, then you have yeah, you're good to go. You should have a lot of uh confidence in your strategy. So, you don't need years of track record. Like you I've seen people raise millions with six months of track record. Just know that your strategy is really solid because if you start managing other people's money, it's a whole different game. It's uh it's now not only your money, right? You have a lot of responsibilities there. Let's see what qu uh without doing a 100,000 tests. Yeah, this is uh something you can make the process rather quick. You don't need 100,000 tests. But I I I get what you mean. Yeah. Sometimes my back test takes crazy long. Can imagine it takes more time time if a system runs every tick instead of every 1 hour candle or something. Do you guys have any tips on speeding up testing without uh needing to move to uh open high close data? Not really. Uh, of course better better PC, but no, I I think the even on a simple system back when I started, we tested on like crappy computers. Um, be very efficient with just your routine. Like every night you go to sleep, run a back like an optimization. Then you wake up at least with 30 to 60 back tests. If you do that every day on a yearly basis, it's a lot of back tests you have done, right? So it's more about that efficiency. You can go to one minute uh data instead of tick data to quickly find where might it work but then quickly move back to every tick data because uh you need to confirm if it is uh correct. But what I've seen is one minute data often gives you a good indication okay these settings work. Now let's we test it on proper tick data and then if that is also good then you're good. Well, the testing currently is not done on Pracis. It's done on Metatrader and we don't own Mandatrader yet. So, we cannot do a lot regarding testing until Profactus AI moves to our own uh testing environment. Also different languages might speed it up because if we move to a different language besides Metatrader 5 then uh that's of course a goal then for the ones that use other testing platforms for let's say Python code then of course back testing becomes way quicker even we'll get there we're still startup we'll dive into If it is possible, we can fix it. Otherwise, we have to reinvent the wheel, which we love to do, but takes a little bit more time. Okay, couple last questions before I go. We'll invest my prop pay out. Nice. Why are you giving us all these tools for free? Well, it shouldn't be that expensive to run this, right? That's uh it helped us. You're welcome. We just want to grow the community here. Perfect AI base. Of course, this uh company is still still small. So, if you can help us grow, um we appreciate it a lot. Um company's far from profitable, but if the community grows, we will grow and we'll all be happy. You're welcome, uh, Nick. Okay, I want to wish everyone a great holidays. Uh, the markets will slow down a little bit for the upcoming two weeks, which will be great for you to test new strategies, develop things, learn, and build that skill level, and also, of course, enjoy your holidays with friends, family, or whoever you love. Thank you for being here and I see you in the new year and that will be probably the second Thursday of January but I'll share that in Discord. Thanks everyone and make sure you use the link in this chat to get the strategy otherwise it will be gone. All right guys, thank you.",

    "text": "All right, let's get started. Build better algorithms faster. That is what I'm going to talk about today. It's a very important topic because a lot of people want to build their strategy, want to automate their trading strategy, but they don't know what is a good trading plan, how do I test this trading plan, how do I optimize it, and what is the best way of doing this. So I thought okay, what did I do the last 10 years? How did I find my trading strategies? I'll give a profitable strategy to you at the end of the session obviously but also talking about the process is more important I think the outcome because if you know how to take these nine steps I'm about to show you then you can do it for yourself you don't need me you don't need anyone else you don't need a mentor anymore you just need to follow those nine steps and that's what I figured out over 10 years and collected in this keynote so let's get started build better algorithms faster is the topic first for the new ones what is Prractice AI. It's the easy tole learn no code builder to automate any trading strategy. If you're trading supply demand, superb resistance, chart patterns, um ICT, SMC concepts, uh whatever you trade, uh you can automate it with profactus. You just need to learn the skill of automation and building it allowing everyone to trade FX, crypto and stock market automatically. So the algorithms run on Metatrader 5 uh which is connected to many many brokers worldwide which allow you to trade FX crypto and stocks. Therefore you can use our algorithms that you build on Prus AI uh across all markets which is very beneficial. I really love that. I like to trade all the markets. Let me tell you why changes the industry a little bit about the story and a little bit about a major problem that is happening in the trading industry that cost a lot of people returns. first, what does every great trader have? That was the first thing I had to solve. Like, okay, there are good traders, there are bad traders, there are uh people that really put in a lot of effort and there are people putting less effort and maybe even getting better returns. So, it was for me really a roller coaster of figuring out what does",

    "text": "a great trader have and if you know that, if you define that, you can make a plan to become one, right? So what does every great trader have first of all is a profitable trading strategy. That is one of the two things every great trader has. How you build that, how you find that, how to get it is all covered in today's keynote. But first, what is the second point? Yes, perfect execution of this strategy. So profitable trading strategy is step one and then perfect execution of the strategy is step two. And some people have very good strategies but cannot um really execute them perfectly due to their emotions or due to their routine, their work, their life, just everything that's going on. And others have that great routine. They have the time to sit behind the charts, but then they probably don't have a profitable trading strategy. So, it's extremely important that you have both. 90% of the traders lose and this is in my opinion really because they don't have both. And we're going to solve that. So you guys will be profitable if you aren't already. And if you are profitable, maybe you want to automate and uh or you want to add another strategy because with automation, you can of course trade manually and also add algorithms to your same account and then boost your performance by using multiple strategies. So it's for everyone. If you're a manual trader or an algo trader, more strategies is almost always better. So you can have a profitable strategy and still lose. How does this happen? Let me quickly cover it for you. If we see a chart here, random strategy, um you see three different positions. A 5% gain, another 5% gain, and a minus 1% loss. So every trade you take, if target is reached, you win five times more than when you're wrong. So if you're wrong, minus 1%, if you're right, plus 5%. These three trades are from a profitable strategy. If you now zoom in and really look at the time statements. The problem",

    "text": "here is I sleep at two at night and at three at night as well, right? I I just go to bed, I sleep, and it's almost impossible or it's not really a good life if you have to be up 24 hours uh to watch the charts and it's very stressful and the lack of sleep will also make you less sharp. You will miss more and it is like a roller coaster. So, what you can see here is you miss the first two trades and then you're awake and you take that third trade. And this is when someone has a profitable strategy but misses a lot of setups. And that's a big problem. Your profitable strategy is now 9% up, but you're down 1%. And what normally happens after this strong winning streak of 9% is you probably your strategy hits a normal losing streak and uh maybe loses a few more trades. That first strategy or your overall strategy is now still in good profits but you are down very badly maybe even losing a funding account or something like that. And that is what we try to solve here. You can also have a perfect routine and also lose. So here you have four trades and this is very common. A lot of people in the industry um back test like a month or maybe two months of price action. They see four trading setups. They took these four trading setups and they think this is the holy grail trading strategy. But what they don't know is the following. You think the strategy is profitable when it is not. And this is very dangerous, maybe even more dangerous than that profitable trading strategy when the routine is not that great because what you execute at least has an edge. If you increase your sample size now, the strategy stops working. And that looks like this. If you zoom out, add more data. So if you back test your strategy on one month, so you look back in time, I did have five setups and then that is profitable. You might assume, okay, this works. But if you then test six months or a year or five years or 10 years, then you really have the big picture, you zoomed out and you really see, all right, my strategy just worked",

    "text": "for a short period of time. And this is very dangerous. And if you have one of these two problems, you will never make it. You'll just hop from strategy to strategy. And you need to solve this. You cannot become profitable without both. That that's the big statement here. And let me now define okay what to do with this information. Profitable trading strategy perfect execution is what you need. How do you get a profitable trading strategy? You back test it. So look back in time. How many times did your setup occur? And then you live life test it. What I normally do my best practice is I back test my strategy over 10 years of data. So it happened hundreds and hundreds of times in the past. Then I build the case. Okay, it will probably work in the future. Then I take a small trading account. So small is of course relative but I would really uh recommend everyone to just take a very small live account or a demo account and then run it on the live markets and then compare the results from your back test with live performance and then really confirm it. Build some more confidence. See how your algorithm performs live and then you build that track record and you get more confidence. Now you see okay it's actually making me money and then you can scale up accordingly. That's what my process is. That has been my process and we literally follow that process with millions under management. Right? So that is a pretty good way of doing things in my opinion. Then step two, perfect execution of the strategy. What do you need? It needs to be emotionless and you always need to be at the charts, right? Because if you sleep, you miss setups. So your algorithm needs to always run. If you have these two things, you are profitable. That's it's that easy. All right, let's dive into more examples. Let's define now or answer better yet this question. How to become a great trader. Have a back tested and live tested profitable strategy that",

    "text": "is executed always without emotions or errors. That is in one statement. If someone asked me how did you become profitable this would be my answer and now we defined everything in one sentence which makes it easier to achieve this goal when I figured this out everything changed for me so I want to talk a little bit about my routine um but also about my journey because I think there are a lot of nuggets in this I won't do it that much because in much detail um because yeah we are here to also learn but I think it's important to share a little more about myself, what helped me to become profitable.

    "text": "become decent they became uh became decent for um maybe you make 20 30 40 R a year so 20 to 40% if you risk 1% uh per per trade and from there I moved okay how can I improve this trading plan because the problem I had was it was very subjective in that trading community there were a a lot of traders and everyone traded a different trading plan and they all adjusted it and some your mentor took a trade and then I missed the trade and it was like was this officially a trade? There were so many questions and then I was like okay I need to become independent. I need to take a step back, take all the information I have and write down a new plan for me that works for me that I can test that I have the data on and that I I don't need anyone else. I can just focus on this. And that was a great great thing I decided to do. I improved the trading plan by manually back testing. So that is literally I remember the December months from back then that I was just sitting in my room just writing uh the trade setups down in an Excel sheet or in my notebook. And from there um a trading plan was made based on supply and demand. Details don't matter but that trading plan worked and that helped me to raise my uh six figures in funding and private capital. This was back in 2018. Then quit my job and I started to live in France. Then I moved to Ebiza for a few months. So that whole 2019 I was gone and that was a great time but also a little bit stressful because I was still trading that manual style. It was very mechanical and profitable so it made life easier but still had to check check the markets every four hours and and yeah we didn't have that many trading setups. I wanted more returns. So I came back to the Netherlands and then we were looking to hire someone and I discovered automation and from that moment we started to automate within my team. We started to automate any trading",

    "text": "strategy and also keep trading manually. And right now um back then it was like we have one automated trading strategy and our manual trading strategy. And now we have like tons of uh automated strategies and still that manual trading strategy. But that manual trading strategy is mostly outperformed by 80% of the algorithms. So if I stop trading that manual trading style, I still make returns. Most of my returns are automated. So trading both is doable. When that one strategy I trade manually stops working, I'll just never trade manual again because why should you, right? If you can also do it automatically without the stress needed. that helped me raise eight figures in funding and private capital and I co-founded Profactors AI to help others access the hedge style of trading. The hedgeon style of trading means that you base everything on data. You automate everything and it's not anymore based on just your subjective opinion. That doesn't work anymore. Algorithms are faster, better and yeah this is in a nutshell my journey. If you uh take all of this, summarize or put it together, I created the workflow, the nine um let's see uh let's see the nine step blueprint to uh become a great trader. That's what I did. And taking that will uh change the game for everyone. This blueprint just helps you step by step what I still do to this day. But people do this uh in until the end of time I think because this is what helps us generate great returns and you can use this blueprint for yourself these nine steps with any trading strategy. So let's start. The first step is finding the right ID to trade. And this is where a lot of people get scared because what are IDs? Can I find a good ID? What makes a good ID? Um, I'm new to trading.",

    "text": "I don't know what an ID is, right? This is very important to understand. And I'll show you how to solve this step one. Every strategy starts with an ID. It could come from a trading community like I had with that first strategy, a research paper, a blog post of your own observation. Maybe you have been sitting behind the charts a lot and you see patterns. You can also just uh look at YouTube, type in trading strategy and you see trading strategies. Believe me, there are millions of them. You can test endlessly. So don't be scared about finding that right trading ID. They are everywhere, but most IDs are not good. But Profactus AI helps you to automate them quickly and just check off all the IDs you see. Let's say you built 100 algorithms this month, then you will definitely find some profitable strategies and you're good to go and you'll have something that works. It's that easy. Let's now formulate the trading idea. The thesis I have is I think that strong price breakouts happen after a period of consolidation or ranging markets. I want to test this. That might be your thought process right now or something you have in your mind. this thesis is not complete yet and what you the first skill you need to develop is to how can I get that idea in my mind to something that I can test and that process that flow you need to train and that costs a few minutes but you need to know how I do it so I think that strong price breakouts happen after period of consolidation I want to test this that's the thesis let's improve this thesis I'm taking one of the global trading sessions and check if price consolidated. If so, I take the breakout trade afterwards. You can make the argument that these two statements are the same. But what I changed is being a little bit more specific. Instead of saying uh just consolidation and ranging, now I defined a range as a global trading session. So that's the",

    "text": "range I'm looking at. So the London session, Asian session, New York session. Um that is what I'm looking at. And then I check if price consolidated. And then I take the breakout trade. Now let's improve it a little bit more. I I will trade the Asian session breakout after yesterday candlestick closed as a dogee pattern. Dogey pattern. If you don't know what it is, go to Google chart patterns and you will have a big list of uh I will show you in this keynote um what it is. But a dogee is just price didn't really move for that last candlestick. It was just you have the high, you have the low and somewhere in the middle you have the body and the close uh the body with the open and the close price. So price didn't really move. If price didn't really move then I define it as consolidation or ranging. Right? The session started and end of the session or end of the day we are still at the same place. Then step two turn the ID in trading blocks. Now we know what we want to look for an Asian breakout with yesterday being a dogey pattern. And then we can build on top of this strategy which we will do in this uh keynote. Turn the ID into trading blocks. Every ID needs an entry, a stop-loss and a target. If we have this, we can create a strategy within proactive AI. If you don't know where to enter, how to take a trade. If you don't have a stop loss, it's way too risky. Always have a stop and you need a target. If you have those things, you can back test it over 10 or 20 years of data. Then at the end of the Asian session, I check if yesterday's scandal closes as a dogey. If so, I will go to the 1 hour time frame and place a buy order at the range high with a stop loss at range low. This is now the trading plan I can build. If we go back, you can see here uh I think that strong price breakouts happen. I have a consolidation. I want to test this. Now, I transformed that to a trading plan. This is a skill you need",

    "text": "to practice. And if you have a trading plan in mind or an ID in your mind, slowly write out what the ID actually is and find an entry, a stop loss, and a target. If you do that, you're very close to being able to automate it already. And what the best stop loss is, what the best target is, what your trade management is, doesn't matter. That comes later. I'll show you how to find the best settings for your strategy. You just need to have the raw ID turned into trading blocks. Here you can see there are so many chart patterns and candlesticks you can automate. Uh it's a huge list. There are billions of things you can do. All right. In perfect CI we have four blocks with this trading algorithm. Super simple. First of all run at time algorithm checks the market at 6:00 in the morning. Some of you guys might already recognize this algorithm. We'll talk about how to improve it and uh some new nuggets. But run time algorithm checks the market at 6:00 in the morning. The run at time block is very important because you need to see it as a manual trader. You wake up at 6:00 in the morning. You one time just look at the charts what is happening right now and then based on that you go through your trading rules and you place a buy order or not. That's what you do, right? Then the second thing is trade rule block. Trade rule block is yesterday is a dogey pattern. If yesterday is a dogey pattern then um if that is correct all right we go to the next block and that's how perfecti works we count the trades don't have any orders placed yet or no trades uh open that's what you do within this count trades block and from there the last block is of course your buy order place the order at the 1 hour high with a stop loss and a target four blocks it takes me I think 15 30 seconds to build this algorithm. If you're new, it will be a few minutes. But the fun thing of building with perfectis AI is at first it is overwhelming. It's a little bit of work and trying to get that skill level and then you become quicker quicker and quicker and then you can imagine how we",

    "text": "build hundreds of algorithms a month. Right? Then at trade management use the break even trail template. We have within profctus we have trade management tra templates and strategy templates can just with one click you can add for instance how to trail your stop loss to break even it will be added to your algorithm you can play around with it I did that but yeah you'll get the file later in this keynote then step three you now had an ID you build it in profactus and we'll look at the code later on and now step three is use visual mode in metatrader 5 why do I do is well I want to see what the algorithm is actually doing if there are no errors if everything is exactly like I expect it to behave. Now to do this you go to X5 export you export the algorithm to your PC and you upload the algorithm to MT5 Metatrader 5. If you don't know how this works then go to docs.profractice.ai AI for free tutorials on how to install MetaTrader 5 for Mac or for for Windows or use a server and how to import into MetaTrader 5. It's just copy paste. But if you need some more guidance, you can just go to docs.practice.ai and we'll help you out with the tutorials there. If you open Metatrader 5, it will look like this. You can see expert symbol, date, forward, like a whole list of things. You open the algorithm and you can see the symbol is dollar yen. The time frame is daily. Within the code, I already made it like it will adjust pair time frame. So you can choose daily, 15 minute, 1 hour, doesn't really matter and the algorithm will take the same trades. But sometimes if you can run your algorithm on a lower time frame and then trades change based on your logic. For now, just run it on the daily or the 1 hour and you're good to go. Then what is important? Deposit 100k. Um and then you have optimization that's disabled. More on that later. And",

    "text": "then you have here visual mode. If you select that a chart will pop up and you'll see a beautiful chart when your where your algorithm is taking trades. How that looks is like this. Here you have a dollar yen running. We have a buy trade a 5.7 lots long with a stop loss nicely placed lower. And then we have a target with a nice risky wart. So this is a a big risk. What you can see is the day before this entry. So one candlestick before you can see hopefully it's clear. You see a small body and a bigger wick. That's that dogey pattern. And then the high breaks and you go long here on the 1 hour. You can see this trade. I made uh 4,200. And you can see here on the 1 hour chart how the trade was executed. Price just triggered the order and price went flying and then the trade was closed automatically. You can also have a a management style there. Maybe no target and then trailing your stop loss. That's something I like to do. Have a big target and a nice uh trailing stop-loss. But after this video, you you know how to test all of this. Next up, step four. Use Metatrader 5 to test all assets quickly. If you find an ID online and this happens a lot, you find an ID on YouTube and someone tells you, \"Okay, this is uh this is the pound dollar trading strategy that will make you rich, right?\" What you need to do is to automate the strategy, follow these steps, but then also, you don't really know if pound dollar is really the best pair to trade because that guy, believe me, that made that video didn't back test all assets. Uh otherwise, he automated maybe then he did it. But if you want to manually back test a trading strategy over 5 to 10 years of data on all assets, you don't have a life. Like that is extreme hard work. Uh and that's normally not what happens. So therefore my step four is always test all assets quickly. Let let the algorithm show me does this work really very well on pound",

    "text": "dollar or is dollar yen better or Aussie yen or uh BTC. I always use this step for how does this work? You can do this all automatically. First market watch. This is your list of um symbols assets in your Metatrader. A yen, euro yen, pound yen, ky yen, dollar yen is what I have here. Of course, in your MetaTrader 5, you probably have the list with everything and that's fine. Then you test your algorithm on everything at once. That will be cool. Let me show you how that works. For this example, I just have a few just the GPY pairs, but that's just for this example. Uh on my normal setup, I also have all of them from RCAT to uh to Kiwi pairs and then also Ethereum, BTC, S&P 500, US30, US 500. Like you can just go down the list. All right. What's important? Test all symbols in market watch. We are back here at strategy tester in Metatrader. Now we select optimization at the bottom and we select all symbols. selected in market watch. If you do that, you can see that I tested this algorithm and you have five different algorithms. Dollar yen, AEN, euren, QEN, pound yen and they all took 200 to 300 trades based on the time period I selected. And you can clearly see the most profits under 28,000 is on dollar yen. So this is the best pair, right? And then the worst pair with these particular settings is pound yen. This doesn't mean that you cannot make this profitable on pound genen, but with this current risk to reward and this trade management and exactly these settings of the strategy, dollar yen is the best outcome. For me, this is super important because it let it lets me skip like all the extra work. It lets me just focus on okay, what works already with this raw trading ID. And it's super important. It really speeds up like okay, it works here. And then you can see here the best pair you have 1.72 that's profit factor that's the higher the profit factor normally",

    "text": "the better the returns but always also look at the max draw down and then we have the return so dollar yen is definitely the best here then step five use metatrader 5 to test the best asset fully now we know that dollar yen is the best one what do I want to now solve well what is the best risk reward when to trail my stop-loss and maybe a thousand other things I want to test, right? Maybe to scale into my positions or test different management styles instead of uh going to break even at one uh percent of profit floating. Maybe I want to uh have a trading stop loss, a big bigger target, maybe something else. You have a lot of questions now like oh what can I test? Let's focus on this first. Strategy tester again symbol dollar yen slow complete algorithm is what you now select. This means that you optimize just dollar yen not anymore all market watch now you're just specifically focused on dollar yen. Click on uh slow complete algorithm and then you'll go to inputs and if you go to inputs also in your metat trader you can see floating profits and target floating profits uh you see start is one step is 0.5 and stop is two. What does start step and stop mean real fast for new people is start is the first test you run. Then after that test is complete you take a step. So you add 0.5 on top of that start amount. So that's 1.5. And then you run that back test. Uh and then another step is 0.5 plus 1.5 is two. And then it stops because you need to end the test some uh sometime. To the right you can see steps. Those are three. This just means I'm testing three settings. Then target. That's my risk-to-reward. My target is 100% of my stop-loss size. You can see I start at 300. So that's a one to three risk-to-reward. My target is three times my stop loss size. And then step is 100. So one R or 1% extra",

    "text": "on profits. And then stop is uh 1,000. So that's a 1 to 10 risk reward. So we what we are testing here is uh 1 to three risk reward, 1 to 4, 1 to 5, 1 to 6, 7, 8, and 1 to 9 and 1 to 10. But at the same time, we also are testing when to trail our stop loss. So they are multiplied three and eight is 24 different back tests. You click on start, go to sleep, you wake up and you have the answer. I did this answer for you already. Now you have this big list. What is this big list? Well, these are all the back test returns of all the settings we just tested. Floating profits uh and the target and a combination of that. The best settings are shown here. Floating profits at two R in profits. So I'm floating I'm taking a buy. I'm floating 2% in profits. Um then I trail my stop loss to break even and then I have a target of one to three. That is uh apparently based on this um the best setting. All right. Then if you doubleclick on this best setting a single uh test will start with those settings and then you have a back test report. You can analyze your equity curve and you can play uh with that and yeah you're more or less done. Then step six, analyze the returns, decide if this is worth more time. Sometimes you follow this process and then this list is not that good. This list might be less profitable, big draw down and then you just had a bad idea. And therefore, it's super important that you don't marry your ID. Don't marry your strategy. I'm a trader. All I care about is making money with my trading strategy. And a lot of people spend a lot of time on a bad strategy. They marry their idea is how I call it. They already spend months on it and now they want to make it work. But for me, what helped a lot is analyze the returns and decide if this worth your time. If this ends up to be bad, which happens",

So you can start there if you don't have any IDs, but I think you guys will have a lot of IDs. Just look for it. Then step seven, document your process and what you tested. This super important. Just write down somewhere in your notes. Okay, I tested this strategy, this ID, this thesis. Now you know that because five years from now, you might forget about it and then you might build the same algorithm again. That's not uh not wise to do. So document this process and then you have a profitable strategy. Now I will share it soon with you. Run the strategy live on a small account and use this track record and strategy to scale up. Run this live for depending on the strategy you trade because if you have every day a trade after a few weeks you might be confident enough to risk a little bit more have a bigger account. But if you only have one trade a week then of course it will take a few months to build that confidence. So if you have a day trading strategy, you can quicker go live probably than if you have a swing trading strategy because you want to see some trades. You build a track record and uh yeah and that strategy and you scale up. Yos, can you share the the link so they can download the code? If you guys have questions, let me know. Yos shared in the in the chat. So you can click there and download the strategy. What I want to do is walk you through this strategy real quick uh while you download it uh and explain what is going on here. So the strategy itself is rather simple. We have uh two parts. We have this part here, the left side and the right side. And this is the perfectus AI canvas. We have run time. That was the first thing I explained to you. We have server time, local time in back testing. It doesn't really make a difference life. It does. uh once per",

    "text": "day at 6:00 in the morning. Why do I use 6:00 in the morning? Well, that is you can check that with your broker and just open your visual mode. You now know how it works. Just see if your algorithm really runs at the right time based on your time settings. Uh to solve that, just open visual mode and look at the first trade at stake and then see if the times are correct. But for me, 6:00 in the morning means um the Asian session has been going on for about 6 hours. So at 6:00 in the morning, I look back at those six hours to just analyze what's what happened. Um do we have a high, a low and all that? Then the trade rule is simple. This is a dogee pattern, which means that the candle body size. So that's the small part uh of the dogee, the open and close price that form the body is smaller than the total size of the whole candle. And that's including the wick. So you have an upper wick and a lower wick. And I multiply that by 0.25. 25. If you really want to have very small bodies with big wigs, you can also change this to uh 0.1. Um, but I kept it on 0.25. I recommend you to test multiple things. And this is just a dogey pattern. Maybe you want to build this algorithm not based on consolidation, but just trade the Asian breakout when momentum happens. So if you have instead of this trading rule checking this maybe you want to check okay yesterday was an engulfing pattern or it was um some some other chart pattern and then I want to take the breakout. You can play around with it. What's important is I set this to the daily time frame. So this block just tracks the candlesticks on the daily time frame. Then I count if I don't have uh or I count if I have less than two trades open. You can also change this, but I have just two trades. And then order count is zero. I don't have an order placed yet. And then buy pending order. You open price. This is a little bit complex, but uh here you select market properties. Then you select C or you select custom price, then market properties, then highest price candle",

    "text": "period. And we are looking back at 6:00 in the morning. And then we look back six candles. All right. So candle five in the morning, four in the morning, three, two, one, zero. Um, just the first one hour candles of the new uh day. Then you do start candle one to six price value and you're good to go. Advanced options, select the 1 hour time frame here, right? Because if you keep this on the daily, then you're looking back six days and selecting the highest price to place your order. That's not what we defined in our trading room.

Select it and now I can adjust it. What is next? Order expiration. I need to delete my order at at least 9 in uh evening. If I don't do it, the order will just be there forever and then until it gets triggered. But if Christ never comes back, it will be just chilling there uh for way too long. I don't want that. delete your order if it's not triggered and you can do that here. Then I went to templates and I added break even trail. So you just",

You can do manual and automated trades but I just do automated trades only. Check floating profits uh here at uh one. So of course it's important to have floating profits there. Optimize it and stop loss to break even happens here. Percent of stop loss to minus 1%. And that's it guys. That is the strategy. If uh check floating profit if this was not selected here, make sure you do it. But um yeah, besides that, this is all you need to know. Let me know. Let's do some questions. Happy to help you out. Uh it's a good time to catch up. Let's do that right now. Let me know in the in the chat uh if you have any questions how to find the right time settings. So this is um um based on your logic.

So we are busy with a lot of new features. Um some of you guys want advanced math. Um you can do a lot in the formula blocks but there are some things that are not there like a square root. If that's there I think you can build any indicator possible. Right now you can build almost all of them but um that will be added. uh volume indicator if um yeah we will add that a lot of",

    "text": "indicators will be added but I prefer to teach you guys also or share with you guys how you can build them yourselves because then you become limitless right um because maybe you want every week a new indicator and then we have to add it but if you know how to use the formula block properly then you can just build any indicator yourself so we're trying to solve that problem to you. Yeah, just give you that superpower that you can just automate any indicator yourself. You just need to understand how it works. But nowadays with chat, you just ask what is the formula of this indicator and then you build it in the formula blocks. So we are trying to find the sweet spot there. What would you recommend in terms of strategy selection when trying to build the best poss? For example, if I already have five breakout strategies, should I continue developing more breakout systems? If breakout strategies work for you, I would recommend to stick to that breakout strategies at least for FX markets and crypto work very well. Um, if you manage those breakout strategies differently and you also enter them on different time frames, you can build a very diversified portfolio based on breakouts. And that's something I discovered myself as well. If FX is not breaking out, go to crypto because there's a very interesting balance. When FX doesn't move, so the forex market is not moving for a few weeks uh for big breakouts, then maybe your performance is slacking a little bit in your portfolio, but then crypto is moving. Crypto doesn't move, stocks are moving, but money is always moving somewhere. It's very rare that like all markets are very quiet. maybe during Christmas but uh even in Christmas due to low liquidity you have big moves and big moves are required for your breakout strategies. So do management diversification. So that means manage your trades differently uh sometimes tight management in maybe uh markets that don't break out that much but also have strategies with slower management that you can catch those big waves.

You can make it work. We do have like some shorter term strategies working on crypto breakout strategies, but optimizations on multiple pairs in one test in Metatrader 5. Is that possible? Like no, that's not possible. Also something uh we are trying to solve that you can uh optimize individually on everything together. If that makes sense. What I showed you in this keynote is how to test one setting on all pairs. And I test and I showed you how to test all settings on one pair. But testing all settings on all pairs in one go is not possible. But I think we can build it in a year. How long do you recommend my track record should be before I start approaching investors to raise private capital? I would do three to six months. If you really follow this process I just showed you, you have a back test of 10 plus years of your strategy working. Those are hundreds or even thousands of trades. That's a lot of confidence you have, right? If you then have a a live performance of just a few months, really compare that live performance with your back test. And if that is the same, then you have yeah, you're good to go. You should have a lot of uh confidence in your strategy. So, you don't need years of track record. Like you I've seen people raise millions with six months of track record. Just know that your strategy is really solid because if you start managing other people's money, it's a whole different game. It's uh it's now not only your money, right? You have a lot of responsibilities there. Let's see what qu uh",

    "text": "without doing a 100,000 tests. Yeah, this is uh something you can make the process rather quick. You don't need 100,000 tests. But I I I get what you mean. Yeah. Sometimes my back test takes crazy long. Can imagine it takes more time time if a system runs every tick instead of every 1 hour candle or something. Do you guys have any tips on speeding up testing without uh needing to move to uh open high close data? Not really. Uh, of course better better PC, but no, I I think the even on a simple system back when I started, we tested on like crappy computers. Um, be very efficient with just your routine. Like every night you go to sleep, run a back like an optimization. Then you wake up at least with 30 to 60 back tests. If you do that every day on a yearly basis, it's a lot of back tests you have done, right? So it's more about that efficiency. You can go to one minute uh data instead of tick data to quickly find where might it work but then quickly move back to every tick data because uh you need to confirm if it is uh correct. But what I've seen is one minute data often gives you a good indication okay these settings work. Now let's we test it on proper tick data and then if that is also good then you're good. Well, the testing currently is not done on Pracis. It's done on Metatrader and we don't own Mandatrader yet. So, we cannot do a lot regarding testing until Profactus AI moves to our own uh testing environment. Also different languages might speed it up because if we move to a different language besides Metatrader 5 then uh that's of course a goal then for the",

Otherwise, we have to reinvent the wheel, which we love to do, but takes a little bit more time. Okay, couple last questions before I go. We'll invest my prop pay out. Nice. Why are you giving us all these tools for free? Well, it shouldn't be that expensive to run this, right? That's uh it helped us. You're welcome. We just want to grow the community here. Perfect AI base. Of course, this uh company is still still small. So, if you can help us grow, um we appreciate it a lot. Um company's far from profitable, but if the community grows, we will grow and we'll all be happy. You're welcome, uh, Nick. Okay, I want to wish everyone a great holidays. Uh, the markets will slow down a little bit for the upcoming two weeks, which will be great for you to test new strategies, develop things, learn, and build that skill level, and also, of course, enjoy your holidays with friends, family, or whoever you love. Thank you for being here and I see you in the new year and that will be probably the second Thursday of January but I'll share that in Discord. Thanks everyone and make sure you use the link in this chat to get the strategy otherwise it will be gone. All right guys, thank you.",

    "text": "You're watching this video because you want to run trading bots the right way, fast, stable, and without relying on your own computer. The Profactor server is built exactly for that. A preconfigured environment where MetaTrader, highquality tick data, and readytouse trading bots are already set up the moment you log in. In the next minutes, I will show you what the server looks like, how quickly you can start back testing and visual testing bots, how the pre-loaded assets work, and how to use the integrated Pracus app to develop and deploy strategies instantly. If you want to fast track your algo trading journey and run bots 24/7 without interruptions, this is where you start. Let's jump in. This is how the profactive server will look like once you are logged in. On the desktop, you see that MetaTrader is already installed. Let's kick off MetaTrader to show you how quickly you will be able on the profactive server to back test your trading bots and also check them in visual mode. You already see our bread and butter breakout system is open but also correctly configured in gray British pound Japanese yen. The only thing I want to change here is checking the box visual mode. So we see what the trading bot is doing. And in fewer than two clicks you already started your trading bot the very first time in visual mode taking its first trade. And from here you can just do what every starter in algorithmic trading should do. Simply observing what the trading system is doing and getting a feeling of the ration and the logic. In that case, it's a breakout system only going long. Obviously, this system is not fully developed yet. So, definitely you will need to go back to profus.ai adding your own 5 cents to make this an actual viable long-term profitable system. In the upper left corner, you see the market watch showing high quality historical price data starting from 2015. So, you can kick off your algo trading journey such as on gold, Bitcoin, Euro USD, and the USA 500. You've already seen that seven assets are preconfigured in every MetaTrader 5 instance, but you can also of course extend it to more when you click here on tick data profactus. You will see a bunch of other assets and its price there. You can also download to extend the back testing capabilities of your MetaTrader 5 terminal. In case you are also looking for a broker, check Black Bull Markets, an official partner of Pracus.ai. You can develop your trading bots on the profactus server. would tremendously increase the speed of your own development of no coding trading bots because this file is also automatically being down and uploaded into the Metatrader 5 number one instance. What comes in very handy when you just going back and forth you iterate and try new stuff. So what you need to do of course again here on the expert advisor clicking refresh and then you see on the folder trading bots by profus test one to three is also showing up. Let me show you the perks like the pre-uploaded trading bots ranging from the price action patterns, the full-fledged trading bots such as the breakout system we already talked about, gold trading bot, the sculp trading bot and the trading bot portfolio inspired by Renealker. If you are a newbie, the core plan is completely sufficient to kick off specs to run your first back tests or live trade your bots while still being capable of doing light back testing and running your systems reliably 24/7. If you're already a little bit more advanced and you have your systems running or you want to simply back test much more, I highly suggest you to go with the prime option which is giving you 8 GB of RAM. The upside of choosing ForexVPS and that is also why we picked this provider. First of all, their two week money back guarantee on all the VPS plans when you are not happy. Once you have purchased the profactus VPS, you will receive such a mail containing the IP address as well as the username and the password of your trading server. Then you go to Microsoft remote desktop app. It's pretty much the same flow. Either you are on Windows already or a Mac user as myself. You then add the PC name or the IP address which is here given as the main IP. So we simply copy paste it right here. It allows you to access the proctor server. And this is how it's going to look like when you initiate it the very first time. To purchase the Pracus server, you simply check link below in the video description.",

    "text": "You're watching this video because you want to run trading bots the right way, fast, stable, and without relying on your own computer. The Profactor server is built exactly for that. A preconfigured environment where MetaTrader, highquality tick data, and readytouse trading bots are already set up the moment you log in. In the next minutes, I will show you what the server looks like, how quickly you can start back testing and visual testing bots, how the pre-loaded assets work, and how to use the integrated Pracus app to develop and deploy strategies instantly. If you want to fast track your algo trading journey and run bots 24/7 without interruptions, this is where you start. Let's jump in. This is how the profactive server will look like once you are logged in. On the desktop, you see that MetaTrader is already installed. Let's kick off MetaTrader to show you how quickly you will be able on the profactive server to back test your trading bots and also check them in visual mode. You already see our bread and butter breakout system is open but also correctly configured in gray British pound Japanese yen. The only thing I want to change here is checking the box visual mode. So we see what the trading bot is doing. And in fewer than two clicks you already started your trading bot the very first time in visual mode taking its first trade. And from here you can just do what every starter in algorithmic trading should do. Simply observing what the trading system is doing and getting a feeling of the ration and the logic. In that case, it's a breakout system only going long. Obviously, this system is not fully",

    "text": "breakout system we already talked about, gold trading bot, the sculp trading bot and the trading bot portfolio inspired by Renealker. If you are a newbie, the core plan is completely sufficient to kick off specs to run your first back tests or live trade your bots while still being capable of doing light back testing and running your systems reliably 24/7. If you're already a little bit more advanced and you have your systems running or you want to simply back test much more, I highly suggest you to go with the prime option which is giving you 8 GB of RAM. The upside of choosing ForexVPS and that is also why we picked this provider. First of all, their two week money back guarantee on all the VPS plans when you are not happy. Once you have purchased the profactus VPS, you will receive such a mail containing the IP address as well as the username and the password of your trading server. Then you go to Microsoft remote desktop app. It's pretty much the same flow. Either you are on Windows already or a Mac user as myself. You then add the PC name or the IP address which is here given as the main IP. So we simply copy paste it right here. It allows you to access the proctor server. And this is how it's going to look like when you initiate it the very first time. To purchase the Pracus server, you simply check link below in the video description.",

    "text": "You're watching this video because you want to stop trading like everyone else. And finally, trade like the 1% who use systems, structure, and automation. If you want to trade like a pro, you can't just click buttons and hope for the best. Think of algorithmic trading like Formula 1. You don't win races by vibing your way around the track. You win because your car, your setup, and your team are dialed in. Right now, you and I, we are building your first race car together. Engine, tires, safety systems, everything that makes the boat actually run. In trading terms, getting Metatrader, setting up your broker, and installing your first trading bot. This is the foundation every profitable algo trader stands on. And most beginners skip it. They rush it, going too fast and crash in the first corner. But not you. If you follow this video step by step, you will already be ahead of 90% of traders who never learn the basics. This is the foundation. Build this right and everything else becomes 10x easier. Tuning and racing, Alia's back testing and live trading comes later. For now, let's get your machine assembled. At this point of time, you have already downloaded your trading bot on your computer and if not, check out the link down below in the video description to access your first trading bot completely templatized. So for you, I will plug a bread and butter trading bot which is a breakout system which is going to look something like this on your canvas. And the only thing you have to do here is in the upper right corner clicking on EX5 and download the file onto your computer. The file you have in your hand right now should look something like this with an ending.ex5. And from here, you're ready to go setting up MetaTrader 5. And a super quick side note, if you don't want the hassle of setting all this up on your own computer, we also offer a fully preconfigured profus server, trading bots installed, highquality tick data ready, MT5 optimized. It's running 24/7. No sleep, no crashes, no my laptop updated overnight disasters anymore. It's the fastest way to get into algo trading, especially for beginners who want zero friction and advanced traders who finally want a stable setup. We partner with Forex Eps, the gold standard in the trading industry. So, you're literally getting prolevel infrastructure for a small monthly buck. If you want the fast track, all details are linked below. Now, let's get you started with a step-by-step tutorial in how to set it up yourself. The very beginning of every algorithmic trading journey is Metatrader 5. For that you simply need to punch in metatrader 5.com where you have to download metatrader 5 for Windows. In case you are a Mac OS user check out the link down below in the video description for a specific step-by-step tutorial for Mac OS users. So for now I will walk you through as a Windows user. You see in your download section MT5 setup.execution file. You simply click on the file. The end user license agreement pops up. Click on next and within a couple of seconds the platform downloads and MetaTrader 5 will ramp up the very first time on your computer. This is how it's going to look like when you initiate MetaTrader 5. For now, simply ignore all the buttons and all the different kind of windows you currently see here cuz our sole goal is to get the just downloaded trading bot running on real price data while watching it in visual mode to really see what the trading system is doing on the charts. And for that you need to sign up with a broker. So you get the data feed into MetaTrader 5 that for now is missing. And if you would start to back test without a broker account, an error would occur. For that you pick your preferred broker. Profacus is an official affiliate with Black Bull Markets, a very reputational broker which affiliate link you will also find down below in the video description. And through the Black Bull sign up flow, I will walk you through the KYC to get your eventually very first trading account, which will be a demo account. Very important. So, it's completely free and you do not need to fund it with real money. We only need pretty much the account number and a password. So, we can punch those credentials into Metatrader 5 to fetch the real price data. This is the goal. When you have clicked the affiliate link of Black Bull Markets, you will get to this signup page where you punch in your email and you fill in all your personal details. What they simply need to know since they are regulated also within the EU and eventually need those information if one day you want to fund it with real money. So once we filled it in, copy paste the verification code we just received in our emails. To fulfill the sign up with Black Bull Markets, we need to fill in some further information. Afterwards, you have to choose your trading preferences. some further information about your employment. You need to click on next. In the next step, you're being asked to upload a proof of your ID. But we can skip this for later when we want to create a life account with real money. But we don't want to do this. Same for the proof of address. We simply will do this in the future when we want to trade real money. But for now, we only want to get the demo account. Now, you simply click here on the left hand side on trading accounts. Click on demo clicking here on the create demo account. And you can pretty much keep all the settings as is. Maybe we go with a slightly higher leverage so we don't run into any margin issues. And we also increase our balance to 100K. We keep the account type at standard for now. And voila, you will have your very first demo trading account and all the credentials now you need. You simply copy the account number. You return to your MetaTrader 5 platform. Then you simply go here in the lower right corner, click on this section. Then on login in the login field, you simply paste the account number. Then you type in your password. And for the server, you simply go back to this window. You see the server name sits right here. Sometimes for other brokers, they have different kind of servers such as demo 1, 2, 3. In that case, we simply have Blackbull Markets demo. So we simply paste it right here. Click on okay. And then usually it takes a couple of seconds until MetaTrader confirms the connection to the trading account. But once it's set up, it's set up for good. Once you logged in, it's going to look something like this. You now have access to real live data provided by in that case black bull markets. And you can see this for example via the market watch window. Now we want to upload our trading bot that we have just downloaded before. So we go to our folder, we go to the file and copy it. Going back to MetaTrader 5. And now we have to do a couple of clicks but they are very simple and straightforward. It's becoming a second nature very soon. Here in the upper left corner you click on file then you go to open data folder. In this window you simply click on MQL5. Then you click on experts. Then you are in the trading bot section. I don't know for what reason but Metatrader 5 is always preconfigured with some trading bots up front which are completely useless. Just for your own sake, you can go ahead and delete those to keep it clean and nice for yourself and create your own folders to simply have a little bit of structure and keeping your different kind of systems nice and tight. I really suggest you to start creating folders from the get- go. In that case, I will simply call this folder my first trading bot. I will go into the folder and paste the execution file of the trading board I've just downloaded before. Now we can close this window and we go to the navigator which is this window and then you click here on expert advisor and you see the files that we've already deleted are still there because now you need to right click on expert advisor go down and click on refresh and now you see our own folder as well as the trading bot within. And now we want to run this trading bot in visual mode. We want to see what it is doing. For that you go here in the upper left corner again clicking on view. Then you click on strategy tester. Now this window is popping up. You can also close the toolbox which we do not need for now which is more for live trading or forward testing. Then you click here on single and I know this breakout strategy is among others but also specifically developed for great British pound Japanese yen. I will simply type it in. I see I don't have it here actually in my list. So what I have to do is simply going to the market watch here. Click to add. I type in great British pound Japanese yen. It's popping up. I click on it. Enter. And now it's here in the list. This means it's also going to pop up here in the shimble list in our strategy tester. So depending on your trading bot, it's really best to check up front on what kind of asset the trading board is supposed to run on, as well as the time frame, which in my case is Great British pound, Japanese yen, the 1 hour time frame. I'll keep the date on its default settings, last year, and the modeling also every tick, which is the most accurate way of testing. But now we want to test in visual mode. So we actually see what the trading bot is doing. And now we will navigate here to the lower right corner. Click on start. What is happening right now? The second window is popping up which is the visual mode. This was our goal. It's taking a moment to show up. Voila. Congratulations. At this point of time you've just started up your trading bot in visual mode in Metatrader 5. And you see exactly what this system is doing. Let me explain you what you see. Obviously here you see the price chart time and price on the right hand side the date window which simply is showing us the different kind of dates when we hovering over here the chart what is the price data open high low close and tick volume can be quite interesting for the analysis you're doing then here it's open up on default on the history tab what I personally prefer is here keeping it on the deals side because then we can exactly see when a trade was taken and closed then besides this we also have the trade tab and we see when we are stopping it right here the system that I've taken here is working with limit orders. So now here obviously the condition was met for this system to place a long order at this price level. We can actually zoom in by clicking here on the plus. I will slow down the price development by using this bar putting a little bit to the left. So we can really see when this trade will be taken. And here in the trade tab, we also see the exact information of this pending order, the price level, as well as the stop- loss and the takerit. Now, we see that the trade was just opened. Let me quickly pause it right here. Zoom out again. And this system is having a massive takerit because it's really trying to fetch the breakouts of the price on great British pound Japanese yen. But it is also having a trailing stop-loss which simply means that when the price is moving 1% the stop loss is trailing right behind securing initial profits on the taken trade. And while we are watching we can also see the current development here the profits of this trade. Now in that case it was not a profitable one. A second trade was just opened. We see the close trade here now in our history tab. Let me pause it right here. When we double click on this line exactly where it was opened right here. And when we double click on the sell outline, we see also exactly when the position was closed, what is right here. What comes in very handy when you have a long list of many many trades and you're going through them. So you can visualize and check them out one by one. So in that case, you just see how the stop-loss in my system is now trailing. What is super nice because now I can really see of what this system is doing and what the logic does. What truly helps, especially as a starter who's just getting into algorithmic trading and struggling with the abstract nature of algorithmic trading, this really, really helps to get a grip on what it actually means to trade with a trading system that is fully automated. Let me close this window right here because now I want to give you a little mini lesson. I'm going back to Profactors AI from where I downloaded this breakout system. And now I want to fiddle around particularly a little bit with the trailing logic. For that I'll click here on trail stop-loss. I open the stop-loss and take profit section. And here for the stop-loss I want to see how the system is behaving when I change the logic based on candle ID to candle ID 1. Which simply means now I'm looking back on the very recent candle low to trail my stop loss. I also suggest to only change one thing at a time which is a best practice. So we stay true to our principle keeping it sophisticated simple. Now we're going to download the new trading system. clicking here on EX5. Then you simply copy paste the newly downloaded execution file. You go back to your MetaTrader 5 platform. Click on file, open data folder. If it's not still open, clicking on experts, my first trading board and simply pasting the new execution file. Then what we have to do clicking on refresh. So now the new trading board is popping up and it's also now showing here in our list. We simply choose the new one, starting it up again. And there you have it. Now the new system is running and now we should see that the trading logic is much much tighter. You see that it's now being placed directly below the most recent candle low in that case. Now we should see it once again. We see here the stop loss again trailed on the most recent low of the prior candle. So it's very very tight. Not sure if you I would like to keep this kind of logic but you see the changes that you do within proacti is having a direct impact obviously on how the system is behaving. And I would say this is really the fun part in figuring out the puzzle yourself on what is a viable trading edge and what are the tweaks and nudges you can do yourself to add your very own 5 cents to the many many different kind of templates we are providing on Pracai on which we have a huge library of pre-built systems provided to you so you do not have to start from scratch even though of course you can do so but especially as a beginner I think it's fantastic that you don't have to start anymore with a blank blank page. I want to close up this video with a little life hack. When we are minimizing the window, so we are not closing it. The calculation is going to be a little bit faster because now your computer doesn't need to care anymore to visualize it. Now we can also see the balance equity curve aka the hardcore outcome of your system how it's doing. So now you see it's running a little bit faster. And then when you see for example, oh there was a massive loss or a massive win, you can simply jump back in, stop the system, go through the trades here in the list, jump back in time and see all the trades piece by piece how it is Right back.",

    "text": "You're watching this video because you want to stop trading like everyone else. And finally, trade like the 1% who use systems, structure, and automation. If you want to trade like a pro, you can't just click buttons and hope for the best. Think of algorithmic trading like Formula 1. You don't win races by vibing your way around the track. You win because your car, your setup, and your team are dialed in. Right now, you and I, we are building your first race car together. Engine, tires, safety systems, everything that makes the boat actually run. In trading terms, getting Metatrader, setting up your broker, and installing your first trading bot. This is the foundation every profitable algo trader stands on. And most beginners skip it. They rush it, going too fast and crash in the first corner. But not you. If you follow this video step by step, you will already be ahead of 90% of traders who never learn the basics. This is the foundation. Build this right and everything else becomes 10x easier. Tuning and racing, Alia's back testing and live trading comes later. For now, let's get your machine assembled. At this point of time, you have already downloaded your trading bot on your computer and if not, check out the link down below in the video description to access your first trading bot completely templatized. So for you, I will plug a bread and butter trading bot which is a breakout system which is going to look something like this on your canvas. And the only thing you have to do here is in the upper right corner clicking on EX5 and download the file onto your computer. The file you have in your hand right now should look something like this with an ending.ex5. And from here, you're ready to go setting up MetaTrader 5. And a super quick side note, if you don't want the hassle of setting all this up on your own computer, we also offer a fully preconfigured profus server, trading bots installed, highquality tick data ready, MT5 optimized. It's running 24/7. No sleep, no crashes, no my laptop updated overnight disasters anymore. It's the fastest way to get into algo trading, especially for beginners who want zero friction and advanced traders who finally want a stable setup. We partner with Forex Eps, the gold standard in the trading industry. So, you're literally getting prolevel infrastructure for a small monthly buck. If you want the fast track, all details are linked below. Now, let's get you started with a step-by-step tutorial in how to set it up yourself. The very beginning of every algorithmic trading journey is Metatrader 5. For that you simply need to punch in metatrader 5.com",

    "text": "where you have to download metatrader 5 for Windows. In case you are a Mac OS user check out the link down below in the video description for a specific step-by-step tutorial for Mac OS users. So for now I will walk you through as a Windows user. You see in your download section MT5 setup.execution file. You simply click on the file. The end user license agreement pops up. Click on next and within a couple of seconds the platform downloads and MetaTrader 5 will ramp up the very first time on your computer. This is how it's going to look like when you initiate MetaTrader 5. For now, simply ignore all the buttons and all the different kind of windows you currently see here cuz our sole goal is to get the just downloaded trading bot running on real price data while watching it in visual mode to really see what the trading system is doing on the charts. And for that you need to sign up with a broker. So you get the data feed into MetaTrader 5 that for now is missing. And if you would start to back test without a broker account, an error would occur. For that you pick your preferred broker. Profacus is an official affiliate with Black Bull Markets, a very reputational broker which affiliate link you will also find down below in the video description. And through the Black Bull sign up flow, I will walk you through the KYC to get your eventually very first trading account, which will be a demo account. Very important. So, it's completely free and you do not need to fund it with real money. We only need pretty much the account number and a password. So, we can punch those credentials into Metatrader 5 to fetch the real price data. This is the goal. When you have clicked the affiliate link of Black Bull Markets, you will get to this signup page where you punch in your email and you fill in all your personal details. What they simply need to know since they are regulated also within the EU and eventually need those information if one day you want to fund it with real money. So once we filled it in, copy paste the verification code we just received in our emails. To fulfill the sign up with Black Bull Markets, we need to fill in some further information. Afterwards, you have to choose your trading preferences. some further information about your employment. You need to click on next. In the next step, you're being asked to upload a proof of your ID. But we can skip this for later when we want to create a life account with real",

    "text": "money. But we don't want to do this. Same for the proof of address. We simply will do this in the future when we want to trade real money. But for now, we only want to get the demo account. Now, you simply click here on the left hand side on trading accounts. Click on demo clicking here on the create demo account. And you can pretty much keep all the settings as is. Maybe we go with a slightly higher leverage so we don't run into any margin issues. And we also increase our balance to 100K. We keep the account type at standard for now. And voila, you will have your very first demo trading account and all the credentials now you need. You simply copy the account number. You return to your MetaTrader 5 platform. Then you simply go here in the lower right corner, click on this section. Then on login in the login field, you simply paste the account number. Then you type in your password. And for the server, you simply go back to this window. You see the server name sits right here. Sometimes for other brokers, they have different kind of servers such as demo 1, 2, 3. In that case, we simply have Blackbull Markets demo. So we simply paste it right here. Click on okay. And then usually it takes a couple of seconds until MetaTrader confirms the connection to the trading account. But once it's set up, it's set up for good. Once you logged in, it's going to look something like this. You now have access to real live data provided by in that case black bull markets. And you can see this for example via the market watch window. Now we want to upload our trading bot that we have just downloaded before. So we go to our folder, we go to the file and copy it. Going back to MetaTrader 5. And now we have to do a couple of clicks but they are very simple and straightforward. It's becoming a second nature very soon. Here in the upper left corner you click on file then you go to open data folder. In this window you simply click on MQL5. Then you click on experts. Then you are in the trading bot section. I don't know for what reason but Metatrader 5 is always preconfigured with some trading bots up front which are completely useless. Just for your own sake, you can go ahead and delete those to keep it clean and nice for yourself and create your own folders to simply have a little bit of structure and keeping your different kind of systems nice and tight. I really suggest you to start creating folders from the get- go. In that case, I will simply call this folder my first trading bot. I will go into the folder and paste the execution file of the trading board I've just",

Now we can close this window and we go to the navigator which is this window and then you click here on expert advisor and you see the files that we've already deleted are still there because now you need to right click on expert advisor go down and click on refresh and now you see our own folder as well as the trading bot within. And now we want to run this trading bot in visual mode. We want to see what it is doing. For that you go here in the upper left corner again clicking on view. Then you click on strategy tester. Now this window is popping up. You can also close the toolbox which we do not need for now which is more for live trading or forward testing. Then you click here on single and I know this breakout strategy is among others but also specifically developed for great British pound Japanese yen. I will simply type it in. I see I don't have it here actually in my list. So what I have to do is simply going to the market watch here. Click to add. I type in great British pound Japanese yen. It's popping up. I click on it. Enter. And now it's here in the list. This means it's also going to pop up here in the shimble list in our strategy tester. So depending on your trading bot, it's really best to check up front on what kind of asset the trading board is supposed to run on, as well as the time frame, which in my case is Great British pound, Japanese yen, the 1 hour time frame. I'll keep the date on its default settings, last year, and the modeling also every tick, which is the most accurate way of testing. But now we want to test in visual mode. So we actually see what the trading bot is doing. And now we will navigate here to the lower right corner. Click on start. What is happening right now? The second window is popping up which is the visual mode. This was our goal. It's taking a moment to show up. Voila. Congratulations. At this point of time you've just started up your trading bot in visual mode in Metatrader 5. And you see exactly what this system is doing. Let me explain you what you see. Obviously here you see the price chart time and price on the right hand side the date window which simply is showing us the different kind of dates when we hovering over here the chart what is the price data open high low close and tick volume can be quite interesting for the analysis you're doing then here it's open up on default on the history tab what I personally prefer is here keeping it on the deals side because then we can exactly see when a trade was taken and",

So now here obviously the condition was met for this system to place a long order at this price level. We can actually zoom in by clicking here on the plus. I will slow down the price development by using this bar putting a little bit to the left. So we can really see when this trade will be taken. And here in the trade tab, we also see the exact information of this pending order, the price level, as well as the stop- loss and the takerit. Now, we see that the trade was just opened. Let me quickly pause it right here. Zoom out again. And this system is having a massive takerit because it's really trying to fetch the breakouts of the price on great British pound Japanese yen. But it is also having a trailing stop-loss which simply means that when the price is moving 1% the stop loss is trailing right behind securing initial profits on the taken trade. And while we are watching we can also see the current development here the profits of this trade. Now in that case it was not a profitable one. A second trade was just opened. We see the close trade here now in our history tab. Let me pause it right here. When we double click on this line exactly where it was opened right here. And when we double click on the sell outline, we see also exactly when the position was closed, what is right here. What comes in very handy when you have a long list of many many trades and you're going through them. So you can visualize and check them out one by one. So in that case, you just see how the stop-loss in my system is now trailing. What is super nice because now I can really see of what this system is doing and what the logic does. What truly helps, especially as a starter who's just getting into algorithmic trading and struggling with the abstract nature of algorithmic trading, this really, really helps to get a grip on what it actually means to trade with a trading system that is fully automated. Let me close this window right here because now I want to give you a little mini lesson. I'm going back to Profactors AI from where I downloaded this breakout system. And now I want to fiddle around particularly a little bit with the trailing logic. For that I'll click here on trail stop-loss. I open the stop-loss and take profit section. And here for the stop-loss I want to see how the system is behaving when I change the",

    "text": "logic based on candle ID to candle ID 1. Which simply means now I'm looking back on the very recent candle low to trail my stop loss. I also suggest to only change one thing at a time which is a best practice. So we stay true to our principle keeping it sophisticated simple. Now we're going to download the new trading system. clicking here on EX5. Then you simply copy paste the newly downloaded execution file. You go back to your MetaTrader 5 platform. Click on file, open data folder. If it's not still open, clicking on experts, my first trading board and simply pasting the new execution file. Then what we have to do clicking on refresh. So now the new trading board is popping up and it's also now showing here in our list. We simply choose the new one, starting it up again. And there you have it. Now the new system is running and now we should see that the trading logic is much much tighter. You see that it's now being placed directly below the most recent candle low in that case. Now we should see it once again. We see here the stop loss again trailed on the most recent low of the prior candle. So it's very very tight. Not sure if you I would like to keep this kind of logic but you see the changes that you do within proacti is having a direct impact obviously on how the system is behaving. And I would say this is really the fun part in figuring out the puzzle yourself on what is a viable trading edge and what are the tweaks and nudges you can do yourself to add your very own 5 cents to the many many different kind of templates we are providing on Pracai on which we have a huge library of pre-built systems provided to you so you do not have to start from scratch even though of course you can do so but especially as a beginner I think it's fantastic that you don't have to start anymore with a blank blank page. I want to close up this video with a little life hack. When we are minimizing the window, so we are not closing it. The calculation is going to be a little bit faster because now your computer doesn't need to care anymore to visualize it. Now we can also see the balance equity curve aka the hardcore outcome of your system how it's doing. So now you see it's running a little bit faster. And then when you see for example, oh there was a massive loss or a massive win, you can simply jump back in, stop the system, go through the trades here in the list, jump back in time and see all the trades piece by piece how it is Right back.",

    "text": "Cool. Let's get started. So, welcome to the second webinar already for Profus AI. We started this project two years ago with building the software and now we are getting somewhere. We're building the base. We have a nice following already in the Discord. And today I want to use time to share a little bit about our platform and then share profitable trading strategy with you that is fully built in Provectors AI. And then at the end of this session, you of course get the link and then you can get the system for yourself, play around with it, use it in the markets. So our main vision is simplifying automated trading for everyone. That's what we do with Prus and that's why we started this company. There was a big need for ourselves to have a no coding platform that we can quickly develop trading strategies like any trading strategy you can imagine. Build that quickly, test it quickly. And after building this software for ourselves for our own usage, we started to think this software can be very beneficial for everyone in the trading industry because it really helped us to become more consistently profitable, more profitable in general because we are allowed to trade more strategies together because we don't have to do it manually anymore. We can just stack strategies and automate them quickly. So this is our vision. But what is Profactus AI? Well, it's the easy tole learn drag and drop builder to automate any trading strategy, allowing everyone to trade forex, crypto, and or stock markets consistently. So, it doesn't really matter if you are trading FX or crypto or stocks. I started out with FX, but now we have algorithms running on all three markets. If you're a total beginner, I would tell you just focus on one market, but later on uh you will develop the same strategies on one market and try and test them out on the other market. So that's amazing to do with this approach. Why you need this? What I learned over the past 10 years with trading is I started fully manual and then slowly I moved to automation and there are three big obstacles I quickly want to outline before we dive in strategy of today and that is people cannot test if something really works. Something that held me back. If I remember my starting days, it all came down to I spotted the strategy online. someone was trading that some um yeah some guy on YouTube or Instagram or uh on the news and I read about it and I was started starting to trade that right away instead of using back testing and really seeing okay let's go back in time see if this pattern actually works repeats itself and it is tradable people cannot test uh if something really works and that's what brought me to to learn automation the second thing is people can't watch the charts 24/7 with full focus. Life gets busy. H you drive to work, you pick up your kids, uh you just are in a meeting, whatever happens, you're not at the charts all t all all day and that really impacts your trading performance because you want to be at the markets when the opportunities are there and the markets don't care about what time it is. So therefore, this is so important to know that if you're not at the charts, news comes in uh that was unexpected or the markets start moving a lot and if you're not there, you miss your trades. And I think everyone here knows that feeling of missing that big 10R move, that big 10% trade uh in a month and that was the only opportunity for that month and now you missed it. Right? With automation that is solved and then people can't trade without emotional bias and mistakes. This is something I struggled with in the early years in my trading career. Uh was that I figured out the human mind and the human brain is just wired to learn from experiences. Right? I've been playing around a lot with AI and how AI system is learning is based on the data and the context you give it. So based on the experiences you describe and it analyzes that and uses that to learn. Well, the human brain brain is exactly the same. With that said, if you have that emotional bias, if you have that experience in the markets, maybe your past like 10 trades were bad trades and you are now in draw down and you might lose your funding account or you're you were so close to passing that prop firm challenge and then the draw down hits, the next trade you take is filled with emotional bias. It's like you have a lot of fear and you're not certain and you're not trading with confidence and that all leads to making mistakes. And the other side is also true. If you have a winning streak, people get greedy and that experience that new data is just in your brain creating that emotional bias for your next position. So when I learned that it was like okay every trade I take has a lot of baggage behind it based on experiences I had and that is another reason that I love automation. So in a nutshell, algorithms catch all the market opportunities, trade, they always trade with confidence and are tested over many years of data. So that is the three big obstacles I had to overcome and you just solve it by just simply automation. Then no coding because a lot of people asked me in the last webinar afterwards I received DMs and all of that from people that were thinking about programming or some people programmed and they asked why are you using no coding? Is that the best approach? Because it's a little bit odd that you're not fully programming your strategies. So, I always use this example. You have three people, manual traders, coders, and no coders. Manual traders, like I said, back testing takes a lot of time. So, building a strategy yourself and manually going through trading view and testing that strategy just takes a ridiculous amount of time to do. And I've done it. Uh we all have done it. But yeah, it's a numbers game. If I give you 10 different trading plans, probably one is really profitable and the rest is not good enough to get funding or sustain your funding. That's just the truth. Uh we figure it out after testing thousands of systems. Then you have the coder and the coder is as slow as that manual trader because it has to automate or he has to automate that strategy first and coding a strategy takes a lot a long time and then testing it is as quickly as we do it of course and then you have no coding and the the example I want to give you is the strategy we're building today together and a profitable strategy I'm about to share with you. We found that online and someone a really advanced programmer uh in MQL language doesn't matter which coding language you are are coding in but he was coding this strategy and it took him around an hour. So that is someone that is a pro, that is very advanced and know what he's doing, right? We did spot that trading plan and we built it in less than 3 minutes with Pracis AI. So it's easier to build with no coding and you are way way faster than any programmer out there. And that's why I love no coding. If you want to automate 10 strategies, see what works, what do I use for my next prop firm challenge, the no coder will win because he can test more strategies quickly. And that is why I love no coding. And I hope that answers the question. By the way, if you guys have any questions, feel free to drop them right now in the discord channel in the chat we are using and then I'll answer them later uh after this call. Yeah. So strategy building time. Let's dive into the strategy of the day. That's probably the reason why all of you guys are here. It is the gold range theory. That's the strategy how we name it. And at the end of this uh keynote, you will get the link and then you click the link and then it pops open in profactus AI and you can download it and use it and test it. But I already tested this strategy for you. This is uh the equity chart of the strategy just the raw version. So you can of course improve it with uh using a different stop-loss, a different risk-to-reward, different management styles, maybe an extra filter that you're thinking about or that you know. And then you have this equity chart. This is a back test on gold, the 15minute time frame. So 15 the 15 minute. And yeah, it works very well on gold. It's a super interesting strategy and I'm going to share the trading plan soon. This back test is pretty big. It's a back test from 2020 until 2025. You can see we have some consolidation in middle but before that and recently crazy good results and a nice strike rate and you can of course improve it like I said to even make it fit your style more or test it on uh maybe uh stocks or test it on FX. This is just gold at the moment. So there's a lot of potential in this strategy. trading plan is super simple and I love simple strategies because nowadays everyone is trading ICT concepts, SMC concepts or some other complex things like supply and demand and I love trading those styles as well but I have figured out that these simple trading plans just keep proving to me keep it simple works especially if you automate it. So, five steps. At 6:00 in the morning, find the high and the low of the past three hours. That's the first thing you do. If you're a manual trader, let's say uh Max wakes up at uh 5:30, then at 6, you sit at your charts and then you find the high and the low of the past 3 hours. That's how you define the range and what we are looking for. Then, step two, if price breaks this high, you buy. If price breaks this low, you sell. Real simple, right? And then you exit at the end of the session. So what is the end of the se session? Well, that is seven in the evening. That's when volatility slows down. So you have the the London session, pre-London session, you find that range. Then price uh more or less wakes up in the London session. Then you also have the New York session. And when that cools down a little bit around 7 in the evening for me in Amsterdam, then you exit your trade. So you don't have a target with this particular trading strategy. You can have a fixed risk reward if you want to test that. Maybe you find better results, but already this equity chart is with this trading plan and only one trade per day is opened. So that's an extra rule in the strategy that I love is okay if the high breaks we have a buy and we are not looking at sells anymore and the other way around. But also this can be easily tested. Just tweak it a little bit in the system. Run that back test. See what it does over the past 500 trades and you have your answer. Right? Every answer you have with trading like what is the best target? What is the best stop loss? What is my management style? What should I do next? Is it targeting that next high or that next low? All those questions that all of us ever had in the markets, they are all answered by just testing, right? Just test it. See what the data tells you. you'll find some interesting things some some things you you never seen before right so in action if you run this algorithm in MetaTrader uh by the way this the the standard color team right now if you upload any system built in proacti you have these colors and you see here that purple line that's the the buy order is executed there you see price from up left really tanked like we were falling hard with uh with gold prices Then it started to consolidate and then we have a buy uh triggered when those highs broke. So this is how markets behave in a nutshell, right? We have big breakouts, big trends, big pushes in price and then we consolidate and we chill out a little bit. So if you want to trade breakouts, wait for that consolidation and then take that breakout because that the then the expectation and the probability is higher that we form a new trend. So the trade was executed and then you can see here the next picture shows you uh that breakout. The candle was now closed. We did see a little bit more consolidation and then a big trend happened and then upright you can see price exited or the algorithm exited this trade. You can also do it manually like I said and yeah then you took your profits and you banked this trade. This of course fully automated and this is the strategy in action. So how to create this one in proactus AI? This is it more or less you have running session that's like a block and in every block on our profactus AI canvas uh a block is just pre-written code. You don't have to code you just connect blocks like legal uh pieces together and then build that strategy. Like I said this is way faster than just programming it yourself. The first block is run in session. And then we have on the left side two trading rules. Then we count trades because I told you in the trading plan we need to figure out how many trades we have taken already or how many trades are open at the moment and we don't want any. So you need to check that. And then a buy now block. That's the left side of the the decision tree. The tree is how I normally call it. And then the right side is trade rule again. Trade rule again. Count trades again. And then sell now. And if you just see this quickly and maybe the first time you see these blocks, I know it might be a little bit overwhelming, but to keep it real simple, you see that buy now block and everything above that is just are the rules to consider a buy trade and to the right you have sell now block and then you can see okay the blocks above that have something to do with what do I want to see in the markets to take a sell order. Then we have modify variables and that's a little bit more of an advanced block. You don't really need to use it in many strategies. You can go without it. And this is more or less a beginner webinar. I want to make it beginner friendly. And so we are not diving into modify variables right now. But we're going to dive into the next blocks. So the first block we did see was run in session. And all this means is when to run the algorithm. I already told you in the trading plan at 6:00 in the morning we want to find a certain high and low and point four was you exit at the end of the session. What is the end of the session? I told you already is 1900 right is just at 7 in the evening. So all we know is this algorithm only trades between 6 in the morning when we start and 7 in the evening right that is your time range. So you can trade the London session, New York session uh or whatever trading session but you can also just define a session yourself and that is in this case six till 1900 and that is called running session. In this block you just define simply when to start when to stop and every block connected below running session. So below this one what you can see all these blocks are only triggered during that time. That's the logic of our building. So that's why you use this block. Then we have the trade rule block. What do you want to see in the markets? A trade rule like the name already tells you is a condition. It it tells you, okay, I want to see this, this, and this happen in the markets. If that happens, cool. Let's check the next block. Uh check the next condition. A trade rule has to the left that green dot and then to the right that more red type of dot. Um the green one is true and the red one is false. In this particular example, you see just one connection and that's the level one the true. You can see that here as well. You see trade rule and then if that is true, you check the next trade rule. If that is true, you go to count trades. If that is true, you go to buy now. If that is true, you continue. And then the algorithm stops. There's nothing below it anymore. So we have two trade rules. Trade rule number one, which you will see when you have the code and you open it up and you want to test this strategy. You will open up the first trade block and you'll see we check if we already had a trade today. That's just a rule to check okay did we have a trade today or not. And then the next trade rule block is the most important one and that was this. If price breaks this high you buy or if price breaks this low you sell. We are now talking about just the left side. So the buy uh uh reasoning and therefore the second trade rule block will have does market price cross the high and then of course we're going to count if we have trades open. If we don't have trades open we continue and then we click on buy now and that is the block that literally executes the trade for you. That's when everything above was confirmed. And then we click on buy now. And there you go. We are live in the markets with a stop-loss set and a target set in place uh if you want to. But you can also within this buy block uh add one more rule and that can be close down my position at 7 in the morning and that rule is also in this buy now block because that was the rule of the trading uh plan. Then one more block I haven't uh shared with you but it's like very important to add it is check spread. What is the spreads in the markets? If there are is a lot of news the spread is widening in the markets and you don't really want to trade when that happens because you click on buy now or your algorithm buys now and then the spread is not that good and then you have a very bad entry price. Therefore, I have this block in the the platform just to protect you from that like before the buy now in between here between count trades and buy now. I would place a spread uh check and then before we buy just checking like okay markets are in a normal environment. There's no news going on. The spreads are nice and I can get a nice entry. That's explaining everything you need to know for this strategy. And now I'm going to share this strategy with you. If you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the Discord right now while I uh work on sharing this with you. I'm going to share the link in the Discord chat. So, make sure you open it up. It will be there for a few minutes for you guys. Meanwhile, text me your questions. All right. The link is in your in the chat. Go click on it, save it, use it. Cool. Any questions, guys, regarding just Profactors AI trading in general? Yoast and Nico are here as well. So the other founders of Profus AI so we can answer all of your questions. Feel free, you can unmute yourself and just talk with us, but you can also, of course, just send them in the Discord chat.",

    "text": "Cool. Let's get started. So, welcome to the second webinar already for Profus AI. We started this project two years ago with building the software and now we are getting somewhere. We're building the base. We have a nice following already in the Discord. And today I want to use time to share a little bit about our platform and then share profitable trading strategy with you that is fully built in Provectors AI. And then at the end of this session, you of course get the link and then you can get the system for yourself, play around with it, use it in the markets. So our main vision is simplifying automated trading for everyone. That's what we do with Prus and that's why we started this company. There was a big need for ourselves to have a no coding platform that we can quickly develop trading strategies like any trading strategy you can imagine. Build that quickly, test it quickly. And after building this software for ourselves for our own usage, we started to think this software can be very beneficial for everyone in the trading industry because it really helped us to become more consistently profitable, more profitable in general because we are allowed to trade more strategies together because we don't have to do it manually anymore. We can just stack strategies and automate them quickly. So this is our vision. But what is Profactus AI? Well, it's the easy tole learn drag and drop builder to automate any trading strategy, allowing everyone to trade forex, crypto, and or stock markets consistently. So, it doesn't really matter if you are trading FX or crypto or stocks. I started out with FX, but now we have algorithms running on all three markets. If you're a total beginner, I would tell you just focus on one market, but later on uh you will develop the same strategies on one market and try and test them out on the other market. So that's amazing to do with this approach. Why you need this? What I learned over the past 10 years with trading is I started fully manual and then slowly I moved to automation and there are three big obstacles I quickly want to outline before we dive in strategy of today and that is people cannot test if something really works.",

    "text": "Something that held me back. If I remember my starting days, it all came down to I spotted the strategy online. someone was trading that some um yeah some guy on YouTube or Instagram or uh on the news and I read about it and I was started starting to trade that right away instead of using back testing and really seeing okay let's go back in time see if this pattern actually works repeats itself and it is tradable people cannot test uh if something really works and that's what brought me to to learn automation the second thing is people can't watch the charts 24/7 with full focus. Life gets busy. H you drive to work, you pick up your kids, uh you just are in a meeting, whatever happens, you're not at the charts all t all all day and that really impacts your trading performance because you want to be at the markets when the opportunities are there and the markets don't care about what time it is. So therefore, this is so important to know that if you're not at the charts, news comes in uh that was unexpected or the markets start moving a lot and if you're not there, you miss your trades. And I think everyone here knows that feeling of missing that big 10R move, that big 10% trade uh in a month and that was the only opportunity for that month and now you missed it. Right? With automation that is solved and then people can't trade without emotional bias and mistakes. This is something I struggled with in the early years in my trading career. Uh was that I figured out the human mind and the human brain is just wired to learn from experiences. Right? I've been playing around a lot with AI and how AI system is learning is based on the data and the context you give it. So based on the experiences you describe and it analyzes that and uses that to learn. Well, the human brain brain is exactly the same. With that said, if you have that emotional bias, if you have that experience in the markets, maybe your past like 10 trades were bad trades and",

    "text": "you are now in draw down and you might lose your funding account or you're you were so close to passing that prop firm challenge and then the draw down hits, the next trade you take is filled with emotional bias. It's like you have a lot of fear and you're not certain and you're not trading with confidence and that all leads to making mistakes. And the other side is also true. If you have a winning streak, people get greedy and that experience that new data is just in your brain creating that emotional bias for your next position. So when I learned that it was like okay every trade I take has a lot of baggage behind it based on experiences I had and that is another reason that I love automation. So in a nutshell, algorithms catch all the market opportunities, trade, they always trade with confidence and are tested over many years of data. So that is the three big obstacles I had to overcome and you just solve it by just simply automation. Then no coding because a lot of people asked me in the last webinar afterwards I received DMs and all of that from people that were thinking about programming or some people programmed and they asked why are you using no coding? Is that the best approach? Because it's a little bit odd that you're not fully programming your strategies. So, I always use this example. You have three people, manual traders, coders, and no coders. Manual traders, like I said, back testing takes a lot of time. So, building a strategy yourself and manually going through trading view and testing that strategy just takes a ridiculous amount of time to do. And I've done it. Uh we all have done it. But yeah, it's a numbers game. If I give you 10 different trading plans, probably one is really profitable and the rest is not good enough to get funding or sustain your funding. That's just the truth. Uh we figure it out after testing thousands of systems. Then you have the coder and the coder is as slow as that manual trader because it has to automate or he has to automate that strategy first and coding a strategy takes a lot a long time and",

    "text": "then testing it is as quickly as we do it of course and then you have no coding and the the example I want to give you is the strategy we're building today together and a profitable strategy I'm about to share with you. We found that online and someone a really advanced programmer uh in MQL language doesn't matter which coding language you are are coding in but he was coding this strategy and it took him around an hour. So that is someone that is a pro, that is very advanced and know what he's doing, right? We did spot that trading plan and we built it in less than 3 minutes with Pracis AI. So it's easier to build with no coding and you are way way faster than any programmer out there. And that's why I love no coding. If you want to automate 10 strategies, see what works, what do I use for my next prop firm challenge, the no coder will win because he can test more strategies quickly. And that is why I love no coding. And I hope that answers the question. By the way, if you guys have any questions, feel free to drop them right now in the discord channel in the chat we are using and then I'll answer them later uh after this call. Yeah. So strategy building time. Let's dive into the strategy of the day. That's probably the reason why all of you guys are here. It is the gold range theory. That's the strategy how we name it. And at the end of this uh keynote, you will get the link and then you click the link and then it pops open in profactus AI and you can download it and use it and test it. But I already tested this strategy for you. This is uh the equity chart of the strategy just the raw version. So you can of course improve it with uh using a different stop-loss, a different risk-to-reward, different management styles, maybe an extra filter that you're thinking about or that you know. And then you have this equity chart. This is a back test on gold, the 15minute time frame. So 15 the 15 minute. And yeah, it works very well on gold. It's a super interesting strategy and I'm going to share the trading plan soon. This back test is pretty big. It's",

    "text": "a back test from 2020 until 2025. You can see we have some consolidation in middle but before that and recently crazy good results and a nice strike rate and you can of course improve it like I said to even make it fit your style more or test it on uh maybe uh stocks or test it on FX. This is just gold at the moment. So there's a lot of potential in this strategy. trading plan is super simple and I love simple strategies because nowadays everyone is trading ICT concepts, SMC concepts or some other complex things like supply and demand and I love trading those styles as well but I have figured out that these simple trading plans just keep proving to me keep it simple works especially if you automate it. So, five steps. At 6:00 in the morning, find the high and the low of the past three hours. That's the first thing you do. If you're a manual trader, let's say uh Max wakes up at uh 5:30, then at 6, you sit at your charts and then you find the high and the low of the past 3 hours. That's how you define the range and what we are looking for. Then, step two, if price breaks this high, you buy. If price breaks this low, you sell. Real simple, right? And then you exit at the end of the session. So what is the end of the se session? Well, that is seven in the evening. That's when volatility slows down. So you have the the London session, pre-London session, you find that range. Then price uh more or less wakes up in the London session. Then you also have the New York session. And when that cools down a little bit around 7 in the evening for me in Amsterdam, then you exit your trade. So you don't have a target with this particular trading strategy. You can have a fixed risk reward if you want to test that. Maybe you find better results, but already this equity chart is with this trading plan and only one trade per day is opened. So that's an extra rule in the strategy that I love",

    "text": "is okay if the high breaks we have a buy and we are not looking at sells anymore and the other way around. But also this can be easily tested. Just tweak it a little bit in the system. Run that back test. See what it does over the past 500 trades and you have your answer. Right? Every answer you have with trading like what is the best target? What is the best stop loss? What is my management style? What should I do next? Is it targeting that next high or that next low? All those questions that all of us ever had in the markets, they are all answered by just testing, right? Just test it. See what the data tells you. you'll find some interesting things some some things you you never seen before right so in action if you run this algorithm in MetaTrader uh by the way this the the standard color team right now if you upload any system built in proacti you have these colors and you see here that purple line that's the the buy order is executed there you see price from up left really tanked like we were falling hard with uh with gold prices Then it started to consolidate and then we have a buy uh triggered when those highs broke. So this is how markets behave in a nutshell, right? We have big breakouts, big trends, big pushes in price and then we consolidate and we chill out a little bit. So if you want to trade breakouts, wait for that consolidation and then take that breakout because that the then the expectation and the probability is higher that we form a new trend. So the trade was executed and then you can see here the next picture shows you uh that breakout. The candle was now closed. We did see a little bit more consolidation and then a big trend happened and then upright you can see price exited or the algorithm exited this trade. You can also do it manually like I said and yeah then you took your profits and you banked this trade. This of course fully automated and this is the strategy in action. So how to create this one in proactus AI? This is it more or less you have running",

    "text": "session that's like a block and in every block on our profactus AI canvas uh a block is just pre-written code. You don't have to code you just connect blocks like legal uh pieces together and then build that strategy. Like I said this is way faster than just programming it yourself. The first block is run in session. And then we have on the left side two trading rules. Then we count trades because I told you in the trading plan we need to figure out how many trades we have taken already or how many trades are open at the moment and we don't want any. So you need to check that. And then a buy now block. That's the left side of the the decision tree. The tree is how I normally call it. And then the right side is trade rule again. Trade rule again. Count trades again. And then sell now. And if you just see this quickly and maybe the first time you see these blocks, I know it might be a little bit overwhelming, but to keep it real simple, you see that buy now block and everything above that is just are the rules to consider a buy trade and to the right you have sell now block and then you can see okay the blocks above that have something to do with what do I want to see in the markets to take a sell order. Then we have modify variables and that's a little bit more of an advanced block. You don't really need to use it in many strategies. You can go without it. And this is more or less a beginner webinar. I want to make it beginner friendly. And so we are not diving into modify variables right now. But we're going to dive into the next blocks. So the first block we did see was run in session. And all this means is when to run the algorithm. I already told you in the trading plan at 6:00 in the morning we want to find a certain high and low and point four was you exit at the end of the session. What is the end of the session? I told you already is 1900 right is just at 7 in the evening. So all we know is this algorithm only trades between 6 in the morning when we start and 7 in the evening right that is your time range.",

    "text": "So you can trade the London session, New York session uh or whatever trading session but you can also just define a session yourself and that is in this case six till 1900 and that is called running session. In this block you just define simply when to start when to stop and every block connected below running session. So below this one what you can see all these blocks are only triggered during that time. That's the logic of our building. So that's why you use this block. Then we have the trade rule block. What do you want to see in the markets? A trade rule like the name already tells you is a condition. It it tells you, okay, I want to see this, this, and this happen in the markets. If that happens, cool. Let's check the next block. Uh check the next condition. A trade rule has to the left that green dot and then to the right that more red type of dot. Um the green one is true and the red one is false. In this particular example, you see just one connection and that's the level one the true. You can see that here as well. You see trade rule and then if that is true, you check the next trade rule. If that is true, you go to count trades. If that is true, you go to buy now. If that is true, you continue. And then the algorithm stops. There's nothing below it anymore. So we have two trade rules. Trade rule number one, which you will see when you have the code and you open it up and you want to test this strategy. You will open up the first trade block and you'll see we check if we already had a trade today. That's just a rule to check okay did we have a trade today or not. And then the next trade rule block is the most important one and that was this. If price breaks this high you buy or if price breaks this low you sell. We are now talking about just the left side. So the buy uh uh reasoning and therefore the second trade rule block will have does market price cross the high and then of course we're going to count if we have trades open. If we don't have trades open we continue and then we",

    "text": "click on buy now and that is the block that literally executes the trade for you. That's when everything above was confirmed. And then we click on buy now. And there you go. We are live in the markets with a stop-loss set and a target set in place uh if you want to. But you can also within this buy block uh add one more rule and that can be close down my position at 7 in the morning and that rule is also in this buy now block because that was the rule of the trading uh plan. Then one more block I haven't uh shared with you but it's like very important to add it is check spread. What is the spreads in the markets? If there are is a lot of news the spread is widening in the markets and you don't really want to trade when that happens because you click on buy now or your algorithm buys now and then the spread is not that good and then you have a very bad entry price. Therefore, I have this block in the the platform just to protect you from that like before the buy now in between here between count trades and buy now. I would place a spread uh check and then before we buy just checking like okay markets are in a normal environment. There's no news going on. The spreads are nice and I can get a nice entry. That's explaining everything you need to know for this strategy. And now I'm going to share this strategy with you. If you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the Discord right now while I uh work on sharing this with you. I'm going to share the link in the Discord chat. So, make sure you open it up. It will be there for a few minutes for you guys. Meanwhile, text me your questions. All right. The link is in your in the chat. Go click on it, save it, use it. Cool. Any questions, guys, regarding just Profactors AI trading in general? Yoast and Nico are here as well. So the other founders of Profus AI so we can answer all of your questions.

    "text": "Welcome everyone. Super excited to share Pracis AI with you. In this session, we going to of course share a strategy with you. We're going to build it together and at the end of this live session, I think it will take 20 30 minutes. I'll share the whole strategy with you. You can use it for yourself, build on top of it, all of that. So, let's start with what is our mission with this company because we started it 18 months ago. We are right now with a team of more than 10 people building this software project and our main mission is simplifying automated trading for everyone. Back in the days when I started to trade, automation was impossible to do unless you were like a crazy good developer. And all those people went to hedge funds because hedge funds smart money. All of those people uh all those institutions were automating technical analysis and just collecting data automating the markets right and we with Profus AI want to simplify this approach that it is finally accessible for all for everyone. So what is Profactus AI? Real simple. It's the easy tole learn drag and drop builder to automate any trading strategy allowing everyone to trade the FX crypto and or stock market consistently. So over the past 10 years, this is not just a keynote I'm doing with becoming profitable and the eight steps and sharing a strategy. This is more or less together with the software. This is like a process over the past 10 years when uh me and co-founders started to trade like all our experience what is important to become profitable in the markets in this crazy industry right there are so many cowboys so many people teaching you different things we were thinking like okay how can we build a platform that has all these eight steps and these eight steps if you master them you will see success in the markets right so these are the eight steps so the right steps to take these are eight things you need as a trader. First of all, the trading style. Trading style we are pushing into the world and how provectors AI is changing the approach of many traders is a datadriven and automated approach. Datadriven first is like just in business every business decision large companies make is based on the data they collect, right? We are living in a data uh and information world and therefore your trading should be data dri driven as well. So you need to have a strategy. You want to test that and really make the argument does this work or not? At least in the past that worked. So you can make the argument, okay, it will work for the next 100 trades or the next thousand trades you take, right? You want a datadriven approach with trading. And automation is the key to that. And besides that, automated strategies, they run while you sleep, so you don't miss setups. And what I've learned over the uh past years is that this is a key game changer that you don't miss those big moves in the London session, Asian session, or whatever session you trade, right? Sometimes life gets busy and if it gets busy, you miss setups, and that's not what you want. Or sometimes you sleep, right, as a trader. Second thing you need is a track record. Easy to verify results. If you learn something from someone, you want to see results, right? And that is super doable with automation. All the back back tests, all the tests you run are not influenced by human emotions. No human bias. It is just the computer executing the setups. The second thing or the third thing is scalability. Run multiple strategies. I know that running one particular trading strategy myself manually can be very difficult. Like I said, you are not at the charts all time. Imagine now having to run two strategies or three or five or 10 strategies for specific markets. FX, crypto, stocks, if you trade all of them, it just gets very overwhelming. With automation, you can just stack all those strategies together and it doesn't require you more work. Then testing, back testing in minutes. One thing this solved for me and really was the game changer is back in the days I took months to collect all the data on a strategy or see if something works or not. Of course, you can watch a video, you can learn something, but then you want to see actually, okay, what are the returns? What can I expect? Back testing in minutes or sometimes if you run big tests, of course, it can take an hour, but it won't take you months anymore. Then risk management, you will never have to calculate any lot sizes ever again, right? If you are sitting behind the charts, you see that setup happen and then at that moment you also have to calculate your lot sizes, your position, your risk and all of that. Um it's very overwhelming as a manual trader and therefore risk management. We had to solve and check that one off as well. And of course automation takes care of all of that. Then funding, psychology, and education. Those three things super important. Funding it's easier to get if you have databacked strategies. So, I've raised millions for my automated strategies and it is just way easier to convince overall outside investors that you have a system that is repeatable and not really based on you. Like if I go away, if something happens to me or I'm offline, I don't know what happens, right? Then still that strategy works and investor capital is safe, right? Uh people like that. And on top of that you have now tens or hundreds maybe even uh prop firms that allocate 100k 200k 400k to traders worldwide right right good traders if you're consistent if you can trade consistently which automation allows you to do getting funded by those prop firms also becomes easier and also getting uh and keeping your accounts right then psychology no emotions no bias at the start obviously if you run a system you need to trust that system. But that's the same with manual trading. But then because you're not at the charts all day because why would you? Because the system is running for you or the systems are um you're not at the charts. So you don't see setups that are not there. You don't have FOMO because you're not emotionally attached to the markets. And that's a big issue we also had to solve with this platform for people. And I think we do that with just making it super simple to understand and super clean and build the trust you need to trust the system. Right? Then education, quick learning curve. I know people that has have been in trading for months. Some see success real uh easily, real fast, but most of them it takes years and years to become profitable. And with automation, I can just give you a system, you test the system, the data tells the story, right? And the quick learning curve is there compared to finding strategies, being in that cycle. Does this work? Looking for the the right thing for you that fits your routine and all of that, right? We all have the same results if we run the same strategies. So, does all of this make sense, guys? So, the good stuff, strategy, building time. I'm quickly going to continue in this keynote and then go to the platform because there are two stages you need to understand with building or automating any strategy. The first stage is understanding the trading plan. So understanding step by step as a manual trader uh what exactly am I doing? What is the setup I'm watching? Right? If you are in trading you know a trading plan is important. Those are just your steps you take before you enter the market or exit the markets. Right? So that is the first stage and then transforming that trading plan to Pracus AI to an automated system. So we're going to do first the trading plan. What I'm going to show you is the golden breakout. What the name already tells you. We run it in on gold. You can also test it on other markets. Um it's already uh good as it is, but you can of course work on it. And some of you guys here are pretty advanced with building as well. you know uh you can take a system and even improve it more right but this is the golden breakout. So here you see some of the results. You can see 200 trades, a nice edge. Um this strategy uh looks pretty good, right? And this is only on one single thing. You can, like I said, test it on more things, combine it and build a portfolio. That's exactly what we do. So the pattern, what you can see here are three candlestick patterns. I want to make it very easy to understand and beginner friendly. So we call this an evening star pattern or star pattern. Um, whenever we see these two three candles, what you want to do is wait for price to break that high and the high is shown with the dotted arrow and then we have the buy U symbol, right? So price uh shows us this, then we wait until that level breaks and then we buy. Very straightforward, right? The second thing is the three highs. What is very important is the red candle you see there is candle number one. The middle candle is candle number two. And then the third candle is candle ID number three. Yeah, those are the three candles. The only rule you should remember here is that the high of two is higher than the one to the right and the left. Right? Two is the highest high. So these are the three highs and they are in this order. That is the pattern. And if that happens like you see here, we wait until the the level crosses and then we buy. This is something you can do manually. But yeah, then you have to watch the charts. We of course fully automated in this session together. So from here the trading plan I divided the trading plan in six simple steps and then you have this profitable strategy. So the first thing we do is at the start of the day find that candle formation. So that's that one, two, three, right? We count from the right to the left which is uh a little bit weird but that's how we count candles and that's also how the platform works and that's also how Meta Trader works. So candle one two and three in that formation is the first thing you do every day. Second thing write down the highest price level because that buy level we need to write down. So as a manual trader you just plot a line there on your trading view for instance or you write it down in your notebook. Uh our algorithm also you write it down. Yeah, that's the second step. Then step three, wait for price to cross the level. Real simple. Then you buy you buy the market with stop- loss and take profit in place. So this is a 5 to1 risk-to-reward with a nice stop-loss placement. You can of course adjust that and back test that, but it's all a more technical stuff I'm not diving into right now. And then yeah, you enter the market or your system enters the market with that set stop loss that you have back tested like what is the best size and what is the best target. Then point five, delete the price level because yeah, now it's cross. You don't need it anymore. And then step six is managing the trade. So if I'm going too fast or you have questions, feel free to drop them in the Discord. I'm going to do a live Q&A at the end of the session, but I just want to move through right now. So or write down or ask it in the chat right now. But let's move on. So all of this here is automated. And back in the days this was the struggle right having a trading plan and whatever trading plan it is there are millions of trading plans and patterns like this you can automate and a few work very well and a lot don't work very well so you want to build these trading plans quickly let the data show you if it works or not and that is the key to success in trading that's what we figured out and that's why we want to push this to the rest that you can also have these results so here you have a chart gold And to the right you see that pattern right? If you see current price and then the last three candles on this chart you see the pattern uh 1 2 3. So that wick in the middle or that biggest candle is uh exactly this pattern right that number two is higher than one and three. Hope that that is clear for you to see. Maybe the screen is a little bit small but this will show you more. This is the fully automated system we're going to build today. You can see we break that high. We have that stop loss. That's the red line uh red dots below. And then we buy the markets and then we have the target and that's the red line at the top. This is the full strategy automated. Then if price moves in profit, you can also trail your stop- loss and do some advanced stuff. All of that is built into the platform. But for now, let's keep it simple. So meet Pracis AI. First of all, real simple, real basic. How does the platform work? Well, it's more or less a decision tree and we have blocks and a block here. You see this is the trade rule block and you connect these blocks. The only thing you need to know is yes and no or true and false. So the left dot you see at the bottom of this block is green and that's yes. So if the trading rule is met, you move to the next trading rule to check that rule. That's the logic here. So if we go back uh start of the day find the candle formation. Whenever there is a day that this candle formation is found, then you move to the next thing which is write down the highest price level etc. Right? If you did that, you move on. So that's how the logic of the platform works. So let's now transform the trading plan in these blogs. I know it's might be a little bit technical if you're um overall new and a beginner but if you join profctors AI you get also a big on boarding with onboarding videos about how all of this works but I think after this session you have a good understanding about the logic of the platform but also from there can run this strategy yourself so run at time so every day point one was start of the day at two so depending where you live and what time zones and all of that doesn't really matter the markets FX markets uh and gold in general close uh every day really shortly and then it opens again and after spread hour and just that period within the market closes you don't want to trade. So I start overall uh this system at 2 at night. I'm sleeping then but the strategy is looking for setups. Then trade rule. So these are two trade rules. Remember what was the trade rule we need? Well, this pattern, right? One, two, and three. So you need two trade rule blocks to automate that. First of all, candle two high is higher than candle than high one. And candle two high is higher than three. So here again as an example uh two is the highest two high the middle candle high is higher than the one to the left and the right. I know I do it really basic but it's very important to know how to translate it now into a system because if you practice this over time you can build a system like this in like 3 minutes right and then start back testing see if it has an edge and that is compared to back in the days when it took you took you maybe weeks or months or you couldn't even do it uh this is the game changer. So after you do do that then you see modify variable that just means write down the price level. So you modify something and that's just see it as writing something on a piece of paper. What are you writing on the piece of paper? Well, that's this high, right? This buy level. Where do you want to buy? Um go back here that dotted arrow. So those are the first three steps you need. If you do this, you're almost there already. And what do you have? Every day you check the markets. Then you find this pattern and then you write down the price level. So with that information what you want to do is take the next steps what to do with the price level. But if we go to the trading plan you can see wait.3 is that wait for price to cross the level. So at two we find the level at two at night because this runs in like a millisecond right and then you're ready to wait for the cross. So we have another decision tree and this is almost the last one. So running session the whole day. I'm just checking something. Then the trading rule, wait for price to cross the level. So within that block, I'm going to show you that imperfect AI. Soon in that block, this trading rule is explained. Wait for price to cross the level. When that happens, I count if I have trades open. As a trader, I know that I don't want to have that much exposure in the markets. I don't want to have to have too many strategies running or too many trades running at that same time. Um, if I have trades open, I just want to uh check that. And that is what you do with that block. You can delete it, but I like it. Then check spread. Protect me from bad prices. Uh, spread checking is also what you do as a manual trader, right? You check your in your Metatrader app. Okay, I want to buy right now. What is the spread? Do I get the price I want? Sometimes there is news. Uh, you can of course automate all of that also in a platform. Then buy now. By now we have a stop loss and a target placed and then modify for variables again writing something down or crossing it out right now uh which we do here is delete the price level. So with this these two decision trees is the whole strategy automated and then lastly I add one more thing and that is trade management. You can add it. You don't have to do it. You can also manually uh manage your automated trades. Uh whatever you want to do, but I like to have also management automated. Select trades, select my running trades, check if I'm floating in profits, and then do this one time and trail my stop loss. So, if you go back to this example here, you can see I'm floating a little bit in profit, right? We broke the high and this trade banks I believe 5 R. So it goes all the way to the target but around the middle I want to check okay am I floating in good profits maybe 1% or 2% or maybe 4% then I want to trail my stop loss right and that's exactly what you do with this management style so any questions regarding this and then we dive into the platform let's go to profus.ai AI and this is the platform we have here the website you can go through it you can find everything you want updates team all you want but click on this button get started for free and there we go so this is exactly the strategy I just explained to you guys we have that first tree here we have that first tree here and then we have the select trades the only thing that's new right now which you can see is these and these And that's because we also take the other side. So if you want to only have buy trades, this is the what I call the buy side. Uh this is then the sell side. And that's the same for here. So that's extra practice for you guys. Of course, you can ask your questions, but that's extra practice to analyze that. You of course get the link soon uh for this overall project. So what's proacti? Here you have when to trade, these are the trading rules, trading execution. And we try to c categorize all these blocks based on a manual trader. Like what does a manual trader do? How do they think? Right? On top we have templates and more and more and more templates are being added. This strategy maybe one day it becomes a template. Right? Maybe one day uh we also add that to this list here. But for now this is just exclusively for you guys. So with that said, you have your profile. Uh you have your export your file, import files, all of that. Let's dive in to one major important thing first and then into the build is this uh P here. The Pracus P is how I call it and that's your friend. This helps you with whatever you need like the whole documentation, sending us messages, tasks, everything you need, every question you have. probably the answer is right here. So always um click there and look around. There are lessons there, videos there and we are building and updating that very often. Uh all your feedback is implemented or answered and also put in our documentation to make the onboarding perfect for you. Yeah. So first of all, run at time. Um there is there are more blocks here. You can delete these blocks to be honest. Uh but I have them in there. Um we have server time at two. That's just what we talked about in the session. Then the trading rule. So what are we comparing? Well, candle two need high needs to be the highest, right? Compared to one and three. Well, that's what we do here. We have candle candle high two is higher than candle uh one here. Candle ID and that high. Then the next thing you want to check is of course two also needs to be above three. So that's what we do in this uh in this block and then modify variable. So what you do here is we have a lot of shortcuts by the way uh command I or control I and then you or you just click here inputs and variables. Um then you can see some uh settings you want to save in algorithm. Um there are lessons on this. It's a little bit more advanced. You don't need to use this in all your algorithms. I use it sometimes. Um but that's what we do here. We want to have the high so store the high um of two into a variable and that's what we do here. So you can also change like uh high uh and name the blocks whatever you want. Uh but I do it like this. Then what do we have here? Run in session. This was like between two and 10 like before the markets close a little bit. Uh before that I want to have these trees run like every single tick in the markets. This runs this only runs at two once, right? Just run at two and then we collect that high and low and then it's done. This runs every single time. Why? Because we want to see if the um let's the bit price or the ask uh whatever um crosses above the value high which is that high of candle 2. Then we count the trades. Well, that's uh we have zero trades, zero orders for buys or sells is what we have selected. Then check the spread. So you can fill in here 100 or you can use inputs. Like I said, inputs and variables are more advanced. You don't have to use that them. Um but for me, I do use them. But uh like I said, you can learn that by now. That's more or less the only a little bit complex thing you still have to do. But then you have this profitable strategy, right? Um or you just download it and you work around it. Then buy now this very powerful block uh money management. So what's my risk? So if I want to risk 1% you just do that or you put it in an input and then um you have it like that. Um doesn't matter. Then we have stop loss. So stop loss you can do like 0.3 0.35 is the stop-loss size we use for this particular gold strategy. Uh I put it in an input as well. So I can adjust inputs within MetaTrader. That's those are like your settings or uh of your system. So it's nice to make them an input which you do here plus and then uh you can just add inputs and then you put them there. Um and then percentage of stop loss is the TP. You can also make it 500%. So 100% of the stop loss is of course a one to one risk reward. 200% is of course targeting the stop loss uh two times in distance. So one to two risk reward we have a 1 to5 uh but we made an input to test things. Uh auto close trade we don't use that for this particular strategy. And then modify variable we have the high and we change it to the number zero. So we reset it here. You can if you shift uh if you select uh let's say you select these two blocks you open them to compare them. You can see the high uh here you store the candle high of two and then here you reset the high back to zero after you took that trade. That's also what I explained in the keynote. Then select trades open trades check if we are running uh and then an input but you can that is at two so you can also make this two I'm running or floating 2% profit if that happens then you move through and then once per trade you modify your stop loss this is settled to true this is false so nothing happens with the target you can also adjust your target when this above happens um but we're going to move your stop loss to um minus 100 for instance. So your stop loss is 100% of its size. So let's say 30 pips or something. We want to move it 30 pips in profit. So therefore it's minus 100. Um and yeah that is everything you need to know. Then we have run at time at 10. I also cross out the highs and the lows when the tra uh when nothing has happened. But you can also override it. So therefore, this don't focus on this. So join the Discord community. If you have any questions, ask them in the Discord. Go test with this, export this, import it in your Metat Trader 5, play around with it, and ask those questions because if you learn this skill as soon as possible, you can start building strategies. Maybe it sounds complex right now. Maybe it looks a little bit complex right now. I had it as well. But this skill, you learn it once and then you're able to build whatever strategy in a very fast amount of time. And that is just gold in this industry because a lot of retail traders don't have this ability and there's a big edge if you do it right now because so many strategies you can test, find and really see before the rest sees it what works and what doesn't. So thank you for being in this live event. I really appreciate all of you guys and we do this every month and the next session um I'm already excited for.",

    "text": "Welcome everyone. Super excited to share Pracis AI with you. In this session, we going to of course share a strategy with you. We're going to build it together and at the end of this live session, I think it will take 20 30 minutes. I'll share the whole strategy with you. You can use it for yourself, build on top of it, all of that. So, let's start with what is our mission with this company because we started it 18 months ago. We are right now with a team of more than 10 people building this software project and our main mission is simplifying automated trading for everyone. Back in the days when I started to trade, automation was impossible to do unless you were like a crazy good developer. And all those people went to hedge funds because hedge funds smart money. All of those people uh all those institutions were automating technical analysis and just collecting data automating the markets right and we with Profus AI want to simplify this approach that it is finally accessible for all for everyone. So what is Profactus AI? Real simple. It's the easy tole learn drag and drop builder to automate any trading strategy allowing everyone to trade the FX crypto and or stock market consistently. So over the past 10 years, this is not just a keynote I'm doing with becoming profitable and the eight steps and sharing a strategy. This is more or less together with the software. This is like a process over the past 10 years when uh me and co-founders started to trade like all our experience what is important to become profitable in the markets in this crazy industry right there are so many cowboys so many people teaching you different things we were thinking like okay how can we build a platform that has all these eight steps and these eight steps if you master them you will see success in the markets right so these are the eight steps so the right steps to take these are eight things you",

    "text": "need as a trader. First of all, the trading style. Trading style we are pushing into the world and how provectors AI is changing the approach of many traders is a datadriven and automated approach. Datadriven first is like just in business every business decision large companies make is based on the data they collect, right? We are living in a data uh and information world and therefore your trading should be data dri driven as well. So you need to have a strategy. You want to test that and really make the argument does this work or not? At least in the past that worked. So you can make the argument, okay, it will work for the next 100 trades or the next thousand trades you take, right? You want a datadriven approach with trading. And automation is the key to that. And besides that, automated strategies, they run while you sleep, so you don't miss setups. And what I've learned over the uh past years is that this is a key game changer that you don't miss those big moves in the London session, Asian session, or whatever session you trade, right? Sometimes life gets busy and if it gets busy, you miss setups, and that's not what you want. Or sometimes you sleep, right, as a trader. Second thing you need is a track record. Easy to verify results. If you learn something from someone, you want to see results, right? And that is super doable with automation. All the back back tests, all the tests you run are not influenced by human emotions. No human bias. It is just the computer executing the setups. The second thing or the third thing is scalability. Run multiple strategies. I know that running one particular trading strategy myself manually can be very difficult. Like I said, you are not at the charts all time. Imagine now having to run two strategies or three or five or 10 strategies for specific markets. FX, crypto, stocks, if you trade all of them, it just gets very overwhelming. With automation, you can just stack all those strategies together and it doesn't require you more work. Then testing, back testing in minutes. One thing this solved for me and really was the game",

    "text": "changer is back in the days I took months to collect all the data on a strategy or see if something works or not. Of course, you can watch a video, you can learn something, but then you want to see actually, okay, what are the returns? What can I expect? Back testing in minutes or sometimes if you run big tests, of course, it can take an hour, but it won't take you months anymore. Then risk management, you will never have to calculate any lot sizes ever again, right? If you are sitting behind the charts, you see that setup happen and then at that moment you also have to calculate your lot sizes, your position, your risk and all of that. Um it's very overwhelming as a manual trader and therefore risk management. We had to solve and check that one off as well. And of course automation takes care of all of that. Then funding, psychology, and education. Those three things super important. Funding it's easier to get if you have databacked strategies. So, I've raised millions for my automated strategies and it is just way easier to convince overall outside investors that you have a system that is repeatable and not really based on you. Like if I go away, if something happens to me or I'm offline, I don't know what happens, right? Then still that strategy works and investor capital is safe, right? Uh people like that. And on top of that you have now tens or hundreds maybe even uh prop firms that allocate 100k 200k 400k to traders worldwide right right good traders if you're consistent if you can trade consistently which automation allows you to do getting funded by those prop firms also becomes easier and also getting uh and keeping your accounts right then psychology no emotions no bias at the start obviously if you run a system you need to trust that system. But that's the same with manual trading. But then because you're not at the charts all day because why would you? Because the system is running for you or the systems are um you're not at the charts. So you don't see setups that are not there. You don't have FOMO because",

    "text": "you're not emotionally attached to the markets. And that's a big issue we also had to solve with this platform for people. And I think we do that with just making it super simple to understand and super clean and build the trust you need to trust the system. Right? Then education, quick learning curve. I know people that has have been in trading for months. Some see success real uh easily, real fast, but most of them it takes years and years to become profitable. And with automation, I can just give you a system, you test the system, the data tells the story, right? And the quick learning curve is there compared to finding strategies, being in that cycle. Does this work? Looking for the the right thing for you that fits your routine and all of that, right? We all have the same results if we run the same strategies. So, does all of this make sense, guys? So, the good stuff, strategy, building time. I'm quickly going to continue in this keynote and then go to the platform because there are two stages you need to understand with building or automating any strategy. The first stage is understanding the trading plan. So understanding step by step as a manual trader uh what exactly am I doing? What is the setup I'm watching? Right? If you are in trading you know a trading plan is important. Those are just your steps you take before you enter the market or exit the markets. Right? So that is the first stage and then transforming that trading plan to Pracus AI to an automated system. So we're going to do first the trading plan. What I'm going to show you is the golden breakout. What the name already tells you. We run it in on gold. You can also test it on other markets. Um it's already uh good as it is, but you can of course work on it. And some of you guys here are pretty advanced with building as well. you know uh you can take a system and even improve it more right but this is the golden breakout. So here you see some of the results. You can see 200 trades, a nice edge. Um this strategy uh looks",

    "text": "pretty good, right? And this is only on one single thing. You can, like I said, test it on more things, combine it and build a portfolio. That's exactly what we do. So the pattern, what you can see here are three candlestick patterns. I want to make it very easy to understand and beginner friendly. So we call this an evening star pattern or star pattern. Um, whenever we see these two three candles, what you want to do is wait for price to break that high and the high is shown with the dotted arrow and then we have the buy U symbol, right? So price uh shows us this, then we wait until that level breaks and then we buy. Very straightforward, right? The second thing is the three highs. What is very important is the red candle you see there is candle number one. The middle candle is candle number two. And then the third candle is candle ID number three.

This is something you can do manually. But yeah, then you have to watch the charts. We of course fully automated in this session together. So from here the trading plan I divided the trading plan in six simple steps and then you have this profitable strategy. So the first thing we do is at the start of the day find that candle formation. So that's that one, two, three, right? We count from the right to the left which is uh a little bit weird but that's how we count candles and that's also how the platform works and that's also how Meta Trader works. So candle one two and three in that formation is the first thing you do every day. Second thing write down the highest price level because that buy level we need to write down.

    "text": "plot a line there on your trading view for instance or you write it down in your notebook. Uh our algorithm also you write it down. Yeah, that's the second step. Then step three, wait for price to cross the level. Real simple. Then you buy you buy the market with stop- loss and take profit in place. So this is a 5 to1 risk-to-reward with a nice stop-loss placement. You can of course adjust that and back test that, but it's all a more technical stuff I'm not diving into right now. And then yeah, you enter the market or your system enters the market with that set stop loss that you have back tested like what is the best size and what is the best target. Then point five, delete the price level because yeah, now it's cross. You don't need it anymore. And then step six is managing the trade. So if I'm going too fast or you have questions, feel free to drop them in the Discord. I'm going to do a live Q&A at the end of the session, but I just want to move through right now. So or write down or ask it in the chat right now. But let's move on. So all of this here is automated. And back in the days this was the struggle right having a trading plan and whatever trading plan it is there are millions of trading plans and patterns like this you can automate and a few work very well and a lot don't work very well so you want to build these trading plans quickly let the data show you if it works or not and that is the key to success in trading that's what we figured out and that's why we want to push this to the rest that you can also have these results so here you have a chart gold And to the right you see that pattern right? If you see current price and then the last three candles on this chart you see the pattern uh 1 2 3. So that wick in the middle or that biggest candle is uh exactly this pattern right that number two is higher than one and three. Hope that that is clear for you to see. Maybe the screen is a little bit small but this will show you more. This is the fully automated system we're going to build today. You can see we break that high. We have that stop loss. That's the",

    "text": "red line uh red dots below. And then we buy the markets and then we have the target and that's the red line at the top. This is the full strategy automated. Then if price moves in profit, you can also trail your stop- loss and do some advanced stuff. All of that is built into the platform. But for now, let's keep it simple. So meet Pracis AI. First of all, real simple, real basic. How does the platform work? Well, it's more or less a decision tree and we have blocks and a block here. You see this is the trade rule block and you connect these blocks. The only thing you need to know is yes and no or true and false. So the left dot you see at the bottom of this block is green and that's yes. So if the trading rule is met, you move to the next trading rule to check that rule. That's the logic here. So if we go back uh start of the day find the candle formation. Whenever there is a day that this candle formation is found, then you move to the next thing which is write down the highest price level etc. Right? If you did that, you move on. So that's how the logic of the platform works. So let's now transform the trading plan in these blogs. I know it's might be a little bit technical if you're um overall new and a beginner but if you join profctors AI you get also a big on boarding with onboarding videos about how all of this works but I think after this session you have a good understanding about the logic of the platform but also from there can run this strategy yourself so run at time so every day point one was start of the day at two so depending where you live and what time zones and all of that doesn't really matter the markets FX markets uh and gold in general close uh every day really shortly and then it opens again and after spread hour and just that period within the market closes you don't want to trade. So I start overall uh this system at 2 at night. I'm sleeping then but the strategy is looking for setups. Then trade rule. So",

    "text": "these are two trade rules. Remember what was the trade rule we need? Well, this pattern, right? One, two, and three. So you need two trade rule blocks to automate that. First of all, candle two high is higher than candle than high one. And candle two high is higher than three. So here again as an example uh two is the highest two high the middle candle high is higher than the one to the left and the right. I know I do it really basic but it's very important to know how to translate it now into a system because if you practice this over time you can build a system like this in like 3 minutes right and then start back testing see if it has an edge and that is compared to back in the days when it took you took you maybe weeks or months or you couldn't even do it uh this is the game changer. So after you do do that then you see modify variable that just means write down the price level. So you modify something and that's just see it as writing something on a piece of paper. What are you writing on the piece of paper? Well, that's this high, right? This buy level. Where do you want to buy? Um go back here that dotted arrow. So those are the first three steps you need. If you do this, you're almost there already. And what do you have? Every day you check the markets. Then you find this pattern and then you write down the price level. So with that information what you want to do is take the next steps what to do with the price level. But if we go to the trading plan you can see wait.3 is that wait for price to cross the level. So at two we find the level at two at night because this runs in like a millisecond right and then you're ready to wait for the cross. So we have another decision tree and this is almost the last one. So running session the whole day. I'm just checking something. Then the trading rule, wait for price to cross the level. So within that block, I'm going to show you that imperfect AI. Soon in that",

    "text": "block, this trading rule is explained. Wait for price to cross the level. When that happens, I count if I have trades open. As a trader, I know that I don't want to have that much exposure in the markets. I don't want to have to have too many strategies running or too many trades running at that same time. Um, if I have trades open, I just want to uh check that. And that is what you do with that block. You can delete it, but I like it. Then check spread. Protect me from bad prices. Uh, spread checking is also what you do as a manual trader, right? You check your in your Metatrader app. Okay, I want to buy right now. What is the spread? Do I get the price I want? Sometimes there is news. Uh, you can of course automate all of that also in a platform. Then buy now. By now we have a stop loss and a target placed and then modify for variables again writing something down or crossing it out right now uh which we do here is delete the price level. So with this these two decision trees is the whole strategy automated and then lastly I add one more thing and that is trade management. You can add it. You don't have to do it. You can also manually uh manage your automated trades. Uh whatever you want to do, but I like to have also management automated. Select trades, select my running trades, check if I'm floating in profits, and then do this one time and trail my stop loss. So, if you go back to this example here, you can see I'm floating a little bit in profit, right? We broke the high and this trade banks I believe 5 R. So it goes all the way to the target but around the middle I want to check okay am I floating in good profits maybe 1% or 2% or maybe 4% then I want to trail my stop loss right and that's exactly what you do with this management style so any questions regarding this and then we dive into the platform let's go to profus.ai AI and this is the platform we have here the website you can go through it you can find everything you want updates team all you want but click on this button",

    "text": "get started for free and there we go so this is exactly the strategy I just explained to you guys we have that first tree here we have that first tree here and then we have the select trades the only thing that's new right now which you can see is these and these And that's because we also take the other side. So if you want to only have buy trades, this is the what I call the buy side. Uh this is then the sell side. And that's the same for here. So that's extra practice for you guys. Of course, you can ask your questions, but that's extra practice to analyze that. You of course get the link soon uh for this overall project. So what's proacti? Here you have when to trade, these are the trading rules, trading execution. And we try to c categorize all these blocks based on a manual trader. Like what does a manual trader do? How do they think? Right? On top we have templates and more and more and more templates are being added. This strategy maybe one day it becomes a template. Right? Maybe one day uh we also add that to this list here. But for now this is just exclusively for you guys. So with that said, you have your profile. Uh you have your export your file, import files, all of that. Let's dive in to one major important thing first and then into the build is this uh P here. The Pracus P is how I call it and that's your friend. This helps you with whatever you need like the whole documentation, sending us messages, tasks, everything you need, every question you have. probably the answer is right here. So always um click there and look around. There are lessons there, videos there and we are building and updating that very often. Uh all your feedback is implemented or answered and also put in our documentation to make the onboarding perfect for you. Yeah. So first of all, run at time. Um",

    "text": "there is there are more blocks here. You can delete these blocks to be honest. Uh but I have them in there. Um we have server time at two. That's just what we talked about in the session. Then the trading rule. So what are we comparing? Well, candle two need high needs to be the highest, right? Compared to one and three. Well, that's what we do here. We have candle candle high two is higher than candle uh one here. Candle ID and that high. Then the next thing you want to check is of course two also needs to be above three. So that's what we do in this uh in this block and then modify variable. So what you do here is we have a lot of shortcuts by the way uh command I or control I and then you or you just click here inputs and variables. Um then you can see some uh settings you want to save in algorithm. Um there are lessons on this. It's a little bit more advanced. You don't need to use this in all your algorithms. I use it sometimes. Um but that's what we do here. We want to have the high so store the high um of two into a variable and that's what we do here. So you can also change like uh high uh and name the blocks whatever you want. Uh but I do it like this. Then what do we have here? Run in session. This was like between two and 10 like before the markets close a little bit. Uh before that I want to have these trees run like every single tick in the markets. This runs this only runs at two once, right? Just run at two and then we collect that high and low and then it's done. This runs every single time. Why? Because we want to see if the um let's the bit price or the ask uh whatever um crosses above the value high which is that high of candle 2. Then we count the trades. Well, that's uh we have zero trades, zero orders for buys or sells is",

    "text": "what we have selected. Then check the spread. So you can fill in here 100 or you can use inputs. Like I said, inputs and variables are more advanced. You don't have to use that them. Um but for me, I do use them. But uh like I said, you can learn that by now. That's more or less the only a little bit complex thing you still have to do. But then you have this profitable strategy, right? Um or you just download it and you work around it. Then buy now this very powerful block uh money management. So what's my risk? So if I want to risk 1% you just do that or you put it in an input and then um you have it like that. Um doesn't matter. Then we have stop loss. So stop loss you can do like 0.3 0.35 is the stop-loss size we use for this particular gold strategy. Uh I put it in an input as well. So I can adjust inputs within MetaTrader. That's those are like your settings or uh of your system. So it's nice to make them an input which you do here plus and then uh you can just add inputs and then you put them there. Um and then percentage of stop loss is the TP. You can also make it 500%. So 100% of the stop loss is of course a one to one risk reward. 200% is of course targeting the stop loss uh two times in distance. So one to two risk reward we have a 1 to5 uh but we made an input to test things. Uh auto close trade we don't use that for this particular strategy. And then modify variable we have the high and we change it to the number zero. So we reset it here. You can if you shift uh if you select uh let's say you select these two blocks you open them to compare them. You can see the high uh here you store the candle high of two and then here you reset the high back to zero after you took that trade. That's also what I explained in the keynote.",

    "text": "Then select trades open trades check if we are running uh and then an input but you can that is at two so you can also make this two I'm running or floating 2% profit if that happens then you move through and then once per trade you modify your stop loss this is settled to true this is false so nothing happens with the target you can also adjust your target when this above happens um but we're going to move your stop loss to um minus 100 for instance. So your stop loss is 100% of its size. So let's say 30 pips or something. We want to move it 30 pips in profit. So therefore it's minus 100. Um and yeah that is everything you need to know. Then we have run at time at 10. I also cross out the highs and the lows when the tra uh when nothing has happened. But you can also override it. So therefore, this don't focus on this. So join the Discord community. If you have any questions, ask them in the Discord. Go test with this, export this, import it in your Metat Trader 5, play around with it, and ask those questions because if you learn this skill as soon as possible, you can start building strategies. Maybe it sounds complex right now. Maybe it looks a little bit complex right now. I had it as well. But this skill, you learn it once and then you're able to build whatever strategy in a very fast amount of time. And that is just gold in this industry because a lot of retail traders don't have this ability and there's a big edge if you do it right now because so many strategies you can test, find and really see before the rest sees it what works and what doesn't. So thank you for being in this live event. I really appreciate all of you guys and we do this every month and the next session um I'm already excited for.",

    "text": "Welcome to Perfectus AAI, your drag and drop strategy builder. Every trading strategy starts somewhere. Begin with a category like when to trade. Drag and drop run per candle to trigger your strategy on every candlestick close. Each block has a true output. It connects to the next block if the condition is met. Some blocks also have a not true path for when the condition fails. Changed your mind? Just select a block and press delete. Not starting from scratch, choose a ready-made template. Take the breakout strategy. It comes with two trees and you can add more. The left tree is the execution tree where trades are triggered. The right tree is the management tree. It manages your open positions. Hold shift to select multiple blocks, move them, or explore their inner logic.",

    "text": "There we go. So, let's get started. Welcome to this month's live session of Profus AI. We use this session to always share a trading strategy with you guys. We fully automate it. We show you new features in Proctor's AI in a platform. But let's start with one big thing. What do we do here? We are trying to build a company where we simplify automated trading for everyone. And what is Profus AI real quick? It's the easy tole learn no code builder to automate any trading strategy allowing everyone to trade the FX crypto or stock market fully automatically. So back in the days you were trading manually and nowadays you can take everything a human being does and put it into features into an algorithm and then it runs for you. I'm going to show you why that is beneficial and why I moved from manual trading towards automation about five years ago. But let me show you why Pracus AI makes you more money as a trader. So 10 years ago, I started to trade started manually and then moved slowly to fully automating my strategies because it showed me one thing and that is missed trades kill your profits. It's just the fact that you cannot sit behind the charts all day, the markets are moving all day and if you're sleeping and news hits the markets, then you're not there, right? You cannot anticipate a new breakout or a new trades and therefore you miss a lot of profits. Let me show you how this works. So I have here a simple trading strategy, a live track record, one of my many algorithms. And this algorithm I built four years ago, 1486 days it has been running and it made me 150% return. And it's one strategy is fully automated. It has zero missed trades and of course zero mistakes have been made because it the algorithm takes the trade, it manages the trade and it exits the trade with a well- definfined stop-loss at target and everything you need just like I could do it or would do it if I was sitting behind the screens and watching the charts every single minute, 24 hours. Now, let's add your routine to the mix or my routine. What you will see is you're probably living like this. You sleep maybe six to eight hours. You travel maybe one or two hours a day towards your company or your business or where you work and then you're in meetings two three hours and then you have free time. So depending on what you do in your free time that can be working out, can be with friends and family whatever you do every day is quite busy. So, it's fair to say that you can trade maybe focused behind your charts one or two full trading hours a day or for simplicity, let's assume, impossible, but let's assume this you trade from 9 to 5 all day super focused. No one is calling you. You're just sitting behind your charts and you can anticipate every market move or at least jump in and out of the markets and execute your strategy. Everything outside of these 9 to5, so outside of the defined hours, that is classified as a mistrade or an error. So that is like trades you missed because you weren't there. Back to you this algorithm as an example, this strategy of mine, 150% returns are made. And if you only trade 9 to5, you only made 90%. So that's a big difference, right? So if I have my strategy, I back test it over prior data. So I back tested this over 20 years of historical price data and now I've been running it live for four years. My back test more or less if I only trade 9 to5 and also the live returns go from 150% to only 90%. So this proves the point right you have a huge decline in performance if you not automate your trading strategies. the decline will be way bigger if you add your realistic numbers and that is because you cannot trade even 9 to5 during the day like I cannot do it most people cannot be focused for so many hours and not being distracted right so the impact will be even bigger if you do it manually so this is all because you cannot trade 9 to5 with full focus and no error with profus AI you can solve this problem and this is the biggest problem I've seen in the last 10 years in the markets, you miss too many trades and therefore your returns are not good enough. With Perfecto, you can perform exactly how you should perform. So your back test is the same as your live performance. That's why Perfect AI makes you more money. There are two things I want to share with you and then we're going to dive into the strategy I'm sharing today with you. How do you make money with trading? First of all, the method. You need a profitable strategy. So I will show you a very interesting strategy today. a strategy that has been helping me for many years. We have been trading is and it is a pattern that only occurs one time a year and that's the topic of today. But that's one example of a profitable strategy and that's a different strategy than the 150% returns I just showed you. And besides that, we have more and more strategies, right? Because if you automate them, you can build as many strategies as you want and find good ones, but you also find bad ones and you just move on to the next one. So finding a profitable strategy is the method to reach your trading goals. The second thing is the metrics. Executing the strategy perfectly. I can give you the best strategy on earth. But if you cannot execute it, maybe I'm giving you an Asian breakout strategy like an trading strategy that works in the Asian session, but I am here in Amsterdam. So the Asian session is during the night where I normally sleep. So I cannot execute it. So I have a profitable strategy that I cannot execute. And that happens a lot with a lot of people and often they don't even know it. They have a strategy, they test it, but they forget that life is also happening, right? So there's two things. Having a profitable strategy, that's what you need and executing it perfectly. All right, let's dive into what I want to tell you today. This will literally blow your mind. It's something that really helped me. And some of you guys that have been following me since 2018 or 2019 know this pattern. Many also traded this pattern. Last year was a crazy return on this pattern. And this year, just like any other year, we expect it to happen again. In the past 20 years, it almost happens every year. Let me dive into it. Today, we talk about seasonal strategies. What is seasonality? It is a repeating pattern based on time or date. All right. So, that is seasonality and we're going to talk about the seasonal pattern. So pattern that repeats in the market based on a certain time in the day or a certain date during the year. The craziest opportunity happens soon. I've been saying this since 2018 and it's called the yearly gold rush. Of course, we have seen the crazy return of the gold chart this year. I believe it was like 67% up this year for year to date, which is probably one of the biggest years in gold. I believe with the gold standard back in the days we had certain runs as well, but it is just a crazy return. But every time there is a yearly gold rush that repeats in the markets and I'm about to share it with you. So this is gold monthly chart. If you're new to charts, real simple, every candlestick, every bar you see here on the chart represents one month of price action. So you can see here the chart starts at 2015. that we have 2016, 17, 18, 19, 20. I just have just a couple years here. But if you check out this chart, then you're probably just like millions of other traders just seeing a random chart. But within this chart, there's a pattern that repeats itself. And you can see it here. Five times every year I see this pattern. So we have in end of 2016, end of 2017, end of 2018 and 19 and 2020. All right. What do we see in December? There is a gold rush normally around 19th of December. And you can go to the charts and just check out for yourself after this webinar. But you can see that there's a pattern repeating every single time. And this pattern, especially in the year 2019, it really changed everything for me regarding trading. Because this is a pattern. If you trade it well, you can get funded. So, some of you guys want to have prop firm capital. Some people want to just build a beautiful track record. Some people are already funded and they want to have big payouts and just make good return on investment. Right? This is a pattern that really helped me do that. Besides the other strategies we trade, this is just a endofear bonus. I see it. So, this is the pattern again. Seasonality repeating pattern based on time or date. That's this one. So what's the edge? What is what do you do with this? You want to be long. So buying gold during this time of year. But how to build something like that in perfect. And that's what I'm about to share with you right now. So if it happens, maybe it happens. You never know. There never guarantee. But we are in a statistical game, right? We want to have the odds in our favor. And the odds are that this run happens again. You can get funded or large payouts. That is for me again a big goal. We automate it so we can trade all sessions to not miss out. Before I show you proactives AI and build this system step by step with you and then at the end of the session I share the code with you so you can have it and you can play around with it. I want to do a quick story. So the other founders are also in this live webinar now. So they probably know it as well. But 19th of December when this pattern normally starts in the markets that's around Christmas. So some of you guys celebrate Christmas. I love it. But during that time, during that week, you have a lot of festivities like you're doing a lot of things with family, friends or whatever you do. And then also trading gold 247 is very difficult to do. So in the early years, I had to do it manually. And I realized lack of sleep because you have got constant stress that you miss setups, you mismanage them and a lot is going on, right? So that's one big reason that we automated. So what do you need to automate a strategy? It doesn't matter what you trade but this strategy we need four different things. When to start trading? So when does the pattern start? When to stop trading? When is the run over? The run only takes one or two or three months. So we want to also ex exit and stop trading. We are not trading this pattern the whole year because it only occurs during a period of time. So start and stop trading. Then all right Max I know the pattern exists but how do I enter the markets? Big question. And how do you enter? We're going to answer that. And then how to exit the markets. If I have one trade or do I have 10 trades? How do I exit? When do I exit? All these questions we need to answer. And today I'm answering all four of them so you don't have to reinvent the wheel for yourself. First of all, when do we start? 19th of December is one rule you can use. That's the rule I'm going to show you today. But another good rule that you can test is if you have the first bullish weekly close in December after that you start. But for now let's focus on just 19th of December and perhaps yeah some of you guys are quite advanced you can build different filters when do I start trading this but for now 19th of December when do I stop trading? When the move happened when the move is over so we have to define what is the move. Is it like a 100 points that price moves or 70 points like from price $1,000 to 170? What is the move? We need to define that. How to enter multiple intraday 1 hour entries. So on a 1 hour time frame we enter and then every entry, every buy as a fixed risk to reward or a time exit and of course a stop loss and a target in place. That's that risk to reward. We have a 1% stop loss and a one% target. for instance, let's build a strategy like this. So the perfectus AI gold system, the trading plan for buys. So this is the five-step plan I defined for you and this is what we're going to build together. Now in perfe 1 hour time frame, super simple. Then step two is we calculate the target for the run based on current price plus your target points. That's again defining how big will the run be. So for this example for today we use a target of 70 points. So let's say if gold is at 1,000 we expect it to move to 170. Right? So we need to use the current price on the 19th of December and then add 70. But you can also make 100. Right now price is pretty high. So therefore maybe we do a target of a couple hundred points which you can all test this right. Then step three check if the 1 hour close is the highest price of the last 20 candles. So we check on the one hour time frame. Do are we creating new 20our highs or not? Super simple strategy. You can use many different strategies. Back in the days when I traded this manually I used other strategies and entries but with automation this is one of them. and I just automate multiple and see what works the best. That is step three. Then step four is of course we have a 1% stop loss and a 1% target. By the way, if you're writing with me or you have questions, just comment in the chat here of Google Meets and then we'll be doing Q&A after. And then step five, stop trading and close all positions if the overall target price is reached or after the number of days 40 as standard have passed. So let me see if you guys have any questions. So these are the five steps. This is the trading plan for buys. There's no trading plan for sells because I better not sell during a bullish run. That is that's not nice to do. All right. So if you build a perfect I'll share this code. You see a little bit of a messy chart here. You have some buys and you have some you have a lot of buys and then some hit stop loss, some hit target and then at the end of the run to the right you see a lot of trades are being closed for profits. And just this screenshot is from 2024 until January and then the start of January. So not the whole run like the whole bull run would be insane. But just a simple 70 70 target and the return of just this was 30 or 40% profit. So that's pretty good. But like I said the move happened more and more. We have I know some people I helped last year with this strategy that shared the track record that they just went crazy like 100% return. They shared the life track record and yeah I was amazed by it. So everyone will have slightly different returns depending how long you hold the positions but in general fundamentally a very good pattern. So how do how do you test this? This is proactus. Here you see the code in blocks and you click on export and then you go to Metatrader 5 to your advisor folder. You imported that there and then step one start 19th of December on gold the 1 hour time frame. So if this is new to you, we have a lot of tutorials within the Prractice platform, how to install MetaTrader, how to set Metatrader up, that you have this exactly. And then you go to your strategy tester. So where we back test the strategy. Of course, you want to see if your strategy worked last year, the year before, maybe for the past 10 years or 20 years. You want to test your strategy, right? Because if it didn't work in the past, it will definitely not work in the future. And if it worked in the past, then it's likely to work in the future if you build it the correct way. So here you can see I loaded the expert advisor. I selected gold as a symbol on the one hour time frame and then custom period is the 19th of December 2024 and then stop trading in March something like that. That's the period you need to back test this individually per year. So if you and at the end of this session you build this strategy with me or you download it when we provide the link in the chat here then yeah then you can just individually test it every single year right then you see the returns. So you had some losses in that year at the start and then price rises and you banked a lot. Then step two after just running this strategy on the 19th of December on the one hour time frame on gold then the second thing we want to do is calculate the target for the run based on current price plus your target points. This is what I shared before. So how do you build something like that in perfect because that might be very confusing for you because as a human being how would you do it? You look at the charts. It's today 19th of December, imagine. And then you look at gold prices and you write down the number and then you add another number to it, your target point. So today it's at this and we want to target that and then my algorithm stops trading the move happened. We move on. Right? That's what we are currently building here. So we have three blocks that we use for it. Run per candle. So every candle stick close on the 1 hour time frame for instance. We run the algorithm and then we have one trade rule and then we have one modify variable. I'll dive into what it all means. So run per candle. Every step candle they close the algorithm runs. That's like when the algorithm looks at the charts just like you as a human being you are just watching the charts and then the one hour candle closes. So exactly at we started at 12. So that's when an hour closes and then this algorithm would run for a millisecond and check the conditions. Then the second thing is trade rule. I don't have a target set. We want to set that target. We want to have that current price and target points. All right. So example open price is currently zero. That's what is within this trade rule. You will see that when I share the strategy. And then save the open price and then open price plus target. Just like I just described it. You take that open price plus target. Imagine 1,000 is the open price and then the target is 70. Then open price plus target is 170. All right. Yeah. When that is reached, then we stop trading. Check if the 1 hour close is the highest price of the last 20 candles. That is rule number three. How we build this still we have run per candle trade rule modify variable. That's from the prior thing we built. Now we have trade rule and buy now as additional blocks. Curves trade rule have not reached target yet 170 in the example before. Last close is the highest price. This is where you check the 1 hour time frame again and see is the last candle close higher than the past 20 candles before. So the last past 20 hours that would be right here 12. So when it hits one then the algorithm runs checks if this candle that's currently forming between 12 and 1 that closes then and that is compared with 20 hours beforehand and see if this is the highest close because we want to see gold flying right we want to see higher highs when that is completed buy with a onetoone risk rewards within the buy now you set the risk per trade you set the stop loss and you set the target that is again step Four trades have a 1% pop stop loss and a 1% target for one to one risk rewards. Let's assume you have a 100K account. 1% is 1,000 euro risk and then your stop loss is hit. Then you lose 1%. So 1,000 when it is right, you make 1,000. And then step five, stop trading and close all open trades if the overall target price is reached or after the number of days 40 as standard have passed. Very important rule here to be honest. Two different rules. When do I stop trading? When the move happened, I want to turn off the algorithm. It happened. We're done. But also if the move is just taking a lot of time and 40 days passed after the 19th of December, every day we count a trade or every day we count a day. Then when that hits 40, we just want to close all the trades. It's okay. Now the direction was good, but we want to get out. This is how you build that piece. And then we're almost done. run at time end of day and then modify variable count the day 19th of December at the end of the day we're gonna count one and then the 20th of December the algorithm will count another time so then we have two days and it will just count the age of how long the algorithm has been running until it's it's 40 then we have every start of the day we check if if we are older than 40 case the algorithm has to be running 40 days or more. We select the trades and close the trades because we're done trading or we also check if we are above that target price. The move already happened and then we select the buy trades, we close the buy trades and we turn off the algorithm. This is exactly how you build that strategy. Within these blocks there are of course settings but you can take your time and move through them to understand the logic. End of the day, you have a system looking like this. It's not that big. Last month, I shared a huge system and a lot of you guys loved it because it is a system that generates proper payouts. So, it makes money if you are already funded with FDMO and all that, but this month we do a little bit of a smaller build. What to do next? You download it and study the blocks. That's what I recommend you to do because you can adjust a billion other things to maybe make the system even better. That's your goal. If you change the stop loss or the target or the management, you can change everything to fit your style. Maybe you know how to trade gold better than I can. So test it. Let the data tell you these are the best settings. Back test the system year by year individually. Again, super important. If you want to test 2022, then you go to 2021 19th of December and then you start trading over the new year and then somewhere in January or February or March the system will be done and then you have that years of performance. You do need to do it individually or rebuild a system that you can run it in one go but that's not how I build this for you right now. Then change your target. When do you stop trading? I told you 70 points might be a good target. It works more or less every year, but right now 70 points on gold can happen in a day or two because price is at 4,000 or something or it was trading around that level. That's just 2% on the day, even less. But change the targets, see what makes you more money. Play around with the stop loss and take profit. Right now, I share with you a onetoone risk reward because you want to have those quick trades. So you go long exit profits, go long exit profits, go long exit US profits. You want to take those quick moves because due to the interest rates, it's not that nice to hold the position for 40 days. It's better to just take your profits because swap every end of the day will yeah have a major impact on your trading performance. And last thing, make sure you understand how gold lot sizes work. Uh some brokers have different contract sizes in MetaTrader. So make sure if I take a trade what really my risk is per trade, not that that you take a huge position of course that's not wise or what you want. So make sure you understand gold lot sizes before you ever run the system and test it. Of course, it's for demo purposes. And yeah, y can you share the link in the chat here? So, everyone can click on the link and it will open up in your browser and then you have the system. Save it because it is only for people in the live webinars and hit me with questions after you got the link. Questions can be asked either just by unmuting yourself or texting. Whoa, lots of questions. First question, how do you test the target if conditions vary every year? Back testing isn't a good check. You can do it percentage based. Back in the days, we always had a big gold will move 100 points, but you can also make it percentage based, right? So 1% back in 2000 was different than 1% move in 2020 or 1% move in 2025. So I would test that. Make it percentage based. So maybe one year you target 1% is only 40 points and another year you want to have a bigger target. Any reason for the one hour time frame? We want to have a lot of setups. That's the main reason. You can also do the 4 hour. But if you have a very strict trading plan, let's say you only have three trades, then you will not bank that much because you want to stack positions. You want to enter, throw your stop loss to break even. So you're risk free and enter again and then stack in that direction. That's at least what I've seen is the best. So the 1 hour just gives you a lot of entries. You can also go to the 15 minute or lower, but that's a little bit aggressive for me. You can change it. Let's see. Luke, what do you mean with contents? Uh, what are future plans with Perfect AI? Will there be more templates, indicators? We are working on so many different features. First of all, we have a team of AI developers helping us, which will be very nice for you to build on the platform, but also get feedback. So, if you have a question, you don't ask us, but you can be helped by us like as if I'm standing next to you helping you to build. That's one big feature. I cannot share all the features, but a lot about testing and all that. We have so many things in the pipeline now. Slowly I'll release it soon. There will also be a lot with in more templates but also you can build templates, you can share templates, you can share systems easily with others. We are also moving in that direction and more indicators. Yes, we are currently also busy with more indicators. Is there any tool on perfectionis to reverse engineer my MP5 strategy into a template? No, but we can always help you. You can private message us if you have something like that. If you need help building anything, just in the discord channel can just ask around. Yos shared his the template again. There you have it. Click on it and you'll have the code. I'm new to perfect. You have built a system that works great for prop firms past challenges. Yes. Yes. So yesterday someone asked this question in the discord. I shared a two-hour video I made about exactly the strategy I have used and many other people even in this call have used to pass FTMO challenges literally last month. So you could just watch that. It's a two-hour training and then you are pretty advanced. It's all free. Just want to ask since AI is open source can this reduce edge. Yeah. So building a strategy just based on AI doesn't work. You can ask chat whatever you want and it will give you a trading plan. If you don't back test it it's literally bad. AI will not be the holy grail for finding a profitable strategy. How we going to use AI is to really guide you guys to automate it quicker. So if you have an idea maybe like this gold pattern, how do I build it that the system just helps you use these blocks, use these connections, this is and then you can test it. That is how AI will really change the game. But yeah, yeah, you can share the you can use the link just save the link keep working for you at least for a day or so. A lot of questions guys. >> You can't open the link. Any other anyone have a problem with that template link? I shared it in the perfect AI Discord channel. For some people it doesn't load on YouTube live probably the machine or a breakout system. Is it all right? Yo, can you share the MPL file here? Otherwise, but can share the MP5 file here again in the chat just to make sure everyone has it. Maybe too many people loading it. Yeah, that's also possible. >> Yeah, the link works fine. It's just that you have to log in first. And if you want the MQ5 file, can share that as well if you wish. >> It works. >> Yeah, it works. All right. Any other questions, guys? anyone here traded the gold run already or was this totally new information for me? My my main thing with my funded accounts is just I'm going to trade the gold run more aggressively. Maybe I would like to add a little something on the first question about how to define the target. Basically what I did, I made a list from 2017 onwards up to basically last year to uh calculate the days it would move in a straight line and also the percentage move it would do over the years. And there's a pretty clear sign that over the last three years the move we're aiming to catch is around 9 to 15%. And the years before it was around six to seven. that there's a very clear increase in the percentage of move basically due to volatility and I think general trend nature of gold over the last years. So my suggestion would be to aim for slightly higher target maybe the same target as you would have done for 2023 or 2024 and don't look so much at 2017 2018 2019 because those years were very conservative. Yeah, like I said in the call, you can just go to Trading View or whatever charting platform you use and then just go to December and analyze this pattern. Almost every year it occurs and you just want to prepare for when it does. So indeed test everything you have said regarding targets. >> Let's see. Black Friday deal. I don't expect one to be there now. So we have right now we still have launch pricing anyways. So prices are lower than any other competition out there. So no black Friday stuff >> is expected at least. My final suggestion if we basically work through the questions is what you want to do is also look at the year 2020 because the run didn't really basically form the way we are looking at it normally and this will be one of the years where you want to test if your risk settings are according to your risk tolerance. Okay, because you have to have a plan in place if the run doesn't happen the way we expect it to happen. You want to have sort of a limit set as to how many positions you want to lose. That's not really something you can implement in your EA probably, but you do want to check it beforehand just to have your risk management plan set in place. >> You mean 20? >> No, 2020. What you can see in 2020 is there is a move, but it's so small. I think it's only like 40 points upwards and then it just fills. Yeah. You go a bit to the left. Yes, exactly. that bottom. It's that little move, but from the 19th of December, it's only 20 points or 40 points, I believe. Um, >> all right. >> Yeah, that's from December 1st, but a small run. So, in in a situation like that, you want to have a plan in place where you say, \"Okay, this could have been the move. I want to turn it off manually or I decrease my risk or anything like that.\" >> Exactly. All right, guys. Last questions if there are any otherwise we wrap this up everyone asked the system can now still get it from the chat all right I don't see any new questions there's one back testing question you mean right GPU versus CPU we are not the owner of Metatrader 5 so we cannot really adjust much regarding how to test in MT5 but in the future also for more advanced developers we will move away from just MT5 and also be able to export our code in whatever code you want. When that is done, you can back test it way faster maybe on different platforms. For now, we it is what it is. Is it a bad idea to run multiple strategies at the same time on one account? No, we run multiple strategies on one account. Every algorithm is unique. So, they have a unique magic number. You can find that in the proactive AI settings of your project. If your magic number is unique, then you can run multiple strategies on one one. Yeah, exactly what Yost is also saying. Use unique codes, then it's fine. You can run multiple. If you have one algorithm that is managing a trade this way and the other algorithm on the same account is managing trades the different way, the algorithm just looks at what trades are taken by what algorithm and then manages accordingly. with your risk increases, you can reduce your risk per trade, right? If you have a trending strategy that really capitalizes in a market with trends and you have also a mean reversion strategy that trades pullbacks, then running two strategies at one time will benefit because during trending markets, you'll bank, but also during choppy markets, the other one and when one strategy doesn't bank, the other one will be profitable. So you have just the more strategies you add normally if the correlation between strategies is lower then you have a more stable equity chart and stable returns. So yeah that makes sense. Okay. Yeah. So always look at what is my max draw down of what one strategy and then if you add another strategy combine them see what is now my max draw down. Did it increase then the correlation is high. If it decreased then correlation is probably lower or at least the strategies are helping each other. Then I wrap up this webinar now. Thank you all for joining. The next one will be around 11th of December. So put it in your calendar that we share a new strategy and again we do this whole lesson but then of course different topic. It will be the second Thursday in December. So I think that's 11th but I'm not totally sure but would check it out second Thursday of December. All right. There are past sessions yes but if you're not live you don't get the strategies so you can rewatch them and you can find them on the profactus AI YouTube channel. All right guys thank you and this one will be uploaded there as well by the way. Bye guys.",

    "text": "There we go. So, let's get started. Welcome to this month's live session of Profus AI. We use this session to always share a trading strategy with you guys. We fully automate it. We show you new features in Proctor's AI in a platform. But let's start with one big thing. What do we do here? We are trying to build a company where we simplify automated trading for everyone. And what is Profus AI real quick? It's the easy tole learn no code builder to automate any trading strategy allowing everyone to trade the FX crypto or stock market fully automatically. So back in the days you were trading manually and nowadays you can take everything a human being does and put it into features into an algorithm and then it runs for you. I'm going to show you why that is beneficial and why I moved from manual trading towards automation about five years ago. But let me show you why Pracus AI makes you more money as a trader. So 10 years ago, I started to trade started manually and then moved slowly to fully automating my strategies because it showed me one thing and that is missed trades kill your profits. It's just the fact that you cannot sit behind the charts all day, the markets are moving all day and if you're sleeping and news hits the markets, then you're not there, right? You cannot anticipate a new breakout or a new trades and therefore you miss a lot of profits. Let me show you how this works. So I have here a simple trading strategy, a live track record, one of my many algorithms. And this algorithm I built four years ago, 1486 days it has been running and it made me 150% return. And it's one strategy is fully automated. It has zero missed trades and of course zero mistakes have been made because it the algorithm takes the trade, it manages the trade and it exits the trade with a well- definfined stop-loss at target and everything you need just like I could do it or would do it if I was sitting behind the screens and watching the charts every single minute, 24",

    "text": "hours. Now, let's add your routine to the mix or my routine. What you will see is you're probably living like this. You sleep maybe six to eight hours. You travel maybe one or two hours a day towards your company or your business or where you work and then you're in meetings two three hours and then you have free time. So depending on what you do in your free time that can be working out, can be with friends and family whatever you do every day is quite busy. So, it's fair to say that you can trade maybe focused behind your charts one or two full trading hours a day or for simplicity, let's assume, impossible, but let's assume this you trade from 9 to 5 all day super focused. No one is calling you. You're just sitting behind your charts and you can anticipate every market move or at least jump in and out of the markets and execute your strategy. Everything outside of these 9 to5, so outside of the defined hours, that is classified as a mistrade or an error. So that is like trades you missed because you weren't there. Back to you this algorithm as an example, this strategy of mine, 150% returns are made. And if you only trade 9 to5, you only made 90%. So that's a big difference, right? So if I have my strategy, I back test it over prior data. So I back tested this over 20 years of historical price data and now I've been running it live for four years. My back test more or less if I only trade 9 to5 and also the live returns go from 150% to only 90%. So this proves the point right you have a huge decline in performance if you not automate your trading strategies. the decline will be way bigger if you add your realistic numbers and that is because you cannot trade even 9 to5 during the day like I cannot do it most people cannot be focused for so many hours and not being distracted right so",

    "text": "the impact will be even bigger if you do it manually so this is all because you cannot trade 9 to5 with full focus and no error with profus AI you can solve this problem and this is the biggest problem I've seen in the last 10 years in the markets, you miss too many trades and therefore your returns are not good enough. With Perfecto, you can perform exactly how you should perform. So your back test is the same as your live performance. That's why Perfect AI makes you more money. There are two things I want to share with you and then we're going to dive into the strategy I'm sharing today with you. How do you make money with trading? First of all, the method. You need a profitable strategy. So I will show you a very interesting strategy today. a strategy that has been helping me for many years. We have been trading is and it is a pattern that only occurs one time a year and that's the topic of today. But that's one example of a profitable strategy and that's a different strategy than the 150% returns I just showed you. And besides that, we have more and more strategies, right? Because if you automate them, you can build as many strategies as you want and find good ones, but you also find bad ones and you just move on to the next one. So finding a profitable strategy is the method to reach your trading goals. The second thing is the metrics. Executing the strategy perfectly. I can give you the best strategy on earth. But if you cannot execute it, maybe I'm giving you an Asian breakout strategy like an trading strategy that works in the Asian session, but I am here in Amsterdam. So the Asian session is during the night where I normally sleep. So I cannot execute it. So I have a profitable strategy that I cannot execute. And that happens a lot with a lot of people and often they don't even know it. They have a strategy, they test it, but they forget that life is also happening, right? So there's two things. Having a profitable strategy, that's what you need and executing it perfectly. All right, let's dive into what I want to tell you today. This will literally blow your",

    "text": "mind. It's something that really helped me. And some of you guys that have been following me since 2018 or 2019 know this pattern. Many also traded this pattern. Last year was a crazy return on this pattern. And this year, just like any other year, we expect it to happen again. In the past 20 years, it almost happens every year. Let me dive into it. Today, we talk about seasonal strategies. What is seasonality? It is a repeating pattern based on time or date. All right. So, that is seasonality and we're going to talk about the seasonal pattern. So pattern that repeats in the market based on a certain time in the day or a certain date during the year. The craziest opportunity happens soon. I've been saying this since 2018 and it's called the yearly gold rush. Of course, we have seen the crazy return of the gold chart this year. I believe it was like 67% up this year for year to date, which is probably one of the biggest years in gold. I believe with the gold standard back in the days we had certain runs as well, but it is just a crazy return. But every time there is a yearly gold rush that repeats in the markets and I'm about to share it with you. So this is gold monthly chart. If you're new to charts, real simple, every candlestick, every bar you see here on the chart represents one month of price action. So you can see here the chart starts at 2015. that we have 2016, 17, 18, 19, 20. I just have just a couple years here. But if you check out this chart, then you're probably just like millions of other traders just seeing a random chart. But within this chart, there's a pattern that repeats itself. And you can see it here. Five times every year I see this pattern. So we have in end of 2016, end of 2017, end of 2018 and 19 and 2020. All right. What do we see in December? There is a gold rush normally",

    "text": "around 19th of December. And you can go to the charts and just check out for yourself after this webinar. But you can see that there's a pattern repeating every single time. And this pattern, especially in the year 2019, it really changed everything for me regarding trading. Because this is a pattern. If you trade it well, you can get funded. So, some of you guys want to have prop firm capital. Some people want to just build a beautiful track record. Some people are already funded and they want to have big payouts and just make good return on investment. Right? This is a pattern that really helped me do that. Besides the other strategies we trade, this is just a endofear bonus. I see it. So, this is the pattern again. Seasonality repeating pattern based on time or date. That's this one. So what's the edge? What is what do you do with this? You want to be long. So buying gold during this time of year. But how to build something like that in perfect. And that's what I'm about to share with you right now. So if it happens, maybe it happens. You never know. There never guarantee. But we are in a statistical game, right? We want to have the odds in our favor. And the odds are that this run happens again. You can get funded or large payouts. That is for me again a big goal. We automate it so we can trade all sessions to not miss out. Before I show you proactives AI and build this system step by step with you and then at the end of the session I share the code with you so you can have it and you can play around with it. I want to do a quick story. So the other founders are also in this live webinar now. So they probably know it as well. But 19th of December when this pattern normally starts in the markets that's around Christmas. So some of you guys celebrate Christmas. I love it. But during that time, during that week, you have a lot of festivities like you're doing a lot of things with family, friends or whatever you do. And then also trading gold 247 is very difficult to do. So in the early years, I had to do it manually. And I realized lack of sleep because you have got constant stress that you miss",

    "text": "setups, you mismanage them and a lot is going on, right? So that's one big reason that we automated. So what do you need to automate a strategy? It doesn't matter what you trade but this strategy we need four different things. When to start trading? So when does the pattern start? When to stop trading? When is the run over? The run only takes one or two or three months. So we want to also ex exit and stop trading. We are not trading this pattern the whole year because it only occurs during a period of time. So start and stop trading. Then all right Max I know the pattern exists but how do I enter the markets? Big question. And how do you enter? We're going to answer that. And then how to exit the markets. If I have one trade or do I have 10 trades? How do I exit? When do I exit? All these questions we need to answer. And today I'm answering all four of them so you don't have to reinvent the wheel for yourself. First of all, when do we start? 19th of December is one rule you can use. That's the rule I'm going to show you today. But another good rule that you can test is if you have the first bullish weekly close in December after that you start. But for now let's focus on just 19th of December and perhaps yeah some of you guys are quite advanced you can build different filters when do I start trading this but for now 19th of December when do I stop trading? When the move happened when the move is over so we have to define what is the move. Is it like a 100 points that price moves or 70 points like from price $1,000 to 170? What is the move? We need to define that. How to enter multiple intraday 1 hour entries. So on a 1 hour time frame we enter and then every entry, every buy as a fixed risk to reward or a time exit and of course a stop loss and a target in place. That's that risk to reward. We have a 1% stop loss and a one% target. for instance, let's build a strategy like this. So the perfectus AI gold",

    "text": "system, the trading plan for buys. So this is the five-step plan I defined for you and this is what we're going to build together. Now in perfe 1 hour time frame, super simple. Then step two is we calculate the target for the run based on current price plus your target points. That's again defining how big will the run be. So for this example for today we use a target of 70 points. So let's say if gold is at 1,000 we expect it to move to 170. Right? So we need to use the current price on the 19th of December and then add 70. But you can also make 100. Right now price is pretty high. So therefore maybe we do a target of a couple hundred points which you can all test this right. Then step three check if the 1 hour close is the highest price of the last 20 candles. So we check on the one hour time frame. Do are we creating new 20our highs or not? Super simple strategy. You can use many different strategies. Back in the days when I traded this manually I used other strategies and entries but with automation this is one of them. and I just automate multiple and see what works the best. That is step three. Then step four is of course we have a 1% stop loss and a 1% target. By the way, if you're writing with me or you have questions, just comment in the chat here of Google Meets and then we'll be doing Q&A after. And then step five, stop trading and close all positions if the overall target price is reached or after the number of days 40 as standard have passed. So let me see if you guys have any questions. So these are the five steps. This is the trading plan for buys. There's no trading plan for sells because I better not sell during a bullish run. That is that's not nice to do. All right. So if you build a perfect",

    "text": "I'll share this code. You see a little bit of a messy chart here. You have some buys and you have some you have a lot of buys and then some hit stop loss, some hit target and then at the end of the run to the right you see a lot of trades are being closed for profits. And just this screenshot is from 2024 until January and then the start of January. So not the whole run like the whole bull run would be insane. But just a simple 70 70 target and the return of just this was 30 or 40% profit. So that's pretty good. But like I said the move happened more and more. We have I know some people I helped last year with this strategy that shared the track record that they just went crazy like 100% return. They shared the life track record and yeah I was amazed by it. So everyone will have slightly different returns depending how long you hold the positions but in general fundamentally a very good pattern. So how do how do you test this? This is proactus. Here you see the code in blocks and you click on export and then you go to Metatrader 5 to your advisor folder. You imported that there and then step one start 19th of December on gold the 1 hour time frame. So if this is new to you, we have a lot of tutorials within the Prractice platform, how to install MetaTrader, how to set Metatrader up, that you have this exactly. And then you go to your strategy tester. So where we back test the strategy. Of course, you want to see if your strategy worked last year, the year before, maybe for the past 10 years or 20 years. You want to test your strategy, right? Because if it didn't work in the past, it will definitely not work in the future. And if it worked in the past, then it's likely to work in the future if you build it the correct way. So here you can see I loaded the expert advisor. I selected gold as a symbol on the one hour time frame and then custom period is the 19th of December 2024 and then stop trading in",

    "text": "March something like that. That's the period you need to back test this individually per year. So if you and at the end of this session you build this strategy with me or you download it when we provide the link in the chat here then yeah then you can just individually test it every single year right then you see the returns. So you had some losses in that year at the start and then price rises and you banked a lot. Then step two after just running this strategy on the 19th of December on the one hour time frame on gold then the second thing we want to do is calculate the target for the run based on current price plus your target points. This is what I shared before. So how do you build something like that in perfect because that might be very confusing for you because as a human being how would you do it? You look at the charts. It's today 19th of December, imagine. And then you look at gold prices and you write down the number and then you add another number to it, your target point. So today it's at this and we want to target that and then my algorithm stops trading the move happened. We move on. Right? That's what we are currently building here. So we have three blocks that we use for it. Run per candle. So every candle stick close on the 1 hour time frame for instance. We run the algorithm and then we have one trade rule and then we have one modify variable. I'll dive into what it all means. So run per candle. Every step candle they close the algorithm runs. That's like when the algorithm looks at the charts just like you as a human being you are just watching the charts and then the one hour candle closes. So exactly at we started at 12. So that's when an hour closes and then this algorithm would run for a millisecond and check the conditions. Then the second thing is trade rule. I don't have a target set. We want to set that target. We want to have that current price and target points. All right. So",

    "text": "example open price is currently zero. That's what is within this trade rule. You will see that when I share the strategy. And then save the open price and then open price plus target. Just like I just described it. You take that open price plus target. Imagine 1,000 is the open price and then the target is 70. Then open price plus target is 170. All right. Yeah. When that is reached, then we stop trading. Check if the 1 hour close is the highest price of the last 20 candles. That is rule number three. How we build this still we have run per candle trade rule modify variable. That's from the prior thing we built. Now we have trade rule and buy now as additional blocks. Curves trade rule have not reached target yet 170 in the example before. Last close is the highest price. This is where you check the 1 hour time frame again and see is the last candle close higher than the past 20 candles before. So the last past 20 hours that would be right here 12. So when it hits one then the algorithm runs checks if this candle that's currently forming between 12 and 1 that closes then and that is compared with 20 hours beforehand and see if this is the highest close because we want to see gold flying right we want to see higher highs when that is completed buy with a onetoone risk rewards within the buy now you set the risk per trade you set the stop loss and you set the target that is again step Four trades have a 1% pop stop loss and a 1% target for one to one risk rewards. Let's assume you have a 100K account. 1% is 1,000 euro risk",

    "text": "and then your stop loss is hit. Then you lose 1%. So 1,000 when it is right, you make 1,000. And then step five, stop trading and close all open trades if the overall target price is reached or after the number of days 40 as standard have passed. Very important rule here to be honest. Two different rules. When do I stop trading? When the move happened, I want to turn off the algorithm. It happened. We're done. But also if the move is just taking a lot of time and 40 days passed after the 19th of December, every day we count a trade or every day we count a day. Then when that hits 40, we just want to close all the trades. It's okay. Now the direction was good, but we want to get out. This is how you build that piece. And then we're almost done. run at time end of day and then modify variable count the day 19th of December at the end of the day we're gonna count one and then the 20th of December the algorithm will count another time so then we have two days and it will just count the age of how long the algorithm has been running until it's it's 40 then we have every start of the day we check if if we are older than 40 case the algorithm has to be running 40 days or more. We select the trades and close the trades because we're done trading or we also check if we are above that target price. The move already happened and then we select the buy trades, we close the buy trades and we turn off the algorithm. This is exactly how you build that strategy. Within these blocks there are of course settings but you can take your time and move through them to understand the logic. End of the day, you have a system looking like this. It's not that big.",

    "text": "Last month, I shared a huge system and a lot of you guys loved it because it is a system that generates proper payouts. So, it makes money if you are already funded with FDMO and all that, but this month we do a little bit of a smaller build. What to do next? You download it and study the blocks. That's what I recommend you to do because you can adjust a billion other things to maybe make the system even better. That's your goal. If you change the stop loss or the target or the management, you can change everything to fit your style. Maybe you know how to trade gold better than I can. So test it. Let the data tell you these are the best settings. Back test the system year by year individually. Again, super important. If you want to test 2022, then you go to 2021 19th of December and then you start trading over the new year and then somewhere in January or February or March the system will be done and then you have that years of performance. You do need to do it individually or rebuild a system that you can run it in one go but that's not how I build this for you right now. Then change your target. When do you stop trading? I told you 70 points might be a good target. It works more or less every year, but right now 70 points on gold can happen in a day or two because price is at 4,000 or something or it was trading around that level. That's just 2% on the day, even less. But change the targets, see what makes you more money. Play around with the stop loss and take profit. Right now, I share with you a onetoone risk reward because you want to have those quick trades. So you go long exit profits, go long exit profits, go long exit US profits. You want to take those quick moves because due to the interest rates, it's not that nice to hold the position for 40 days. It's better to just take your profits because swap every end of the day will yeah have a major impact on your trading performance. And last thing, make sure you understand",

    "text": "how gold lot sizes work. Uh some brokers have different contract sizes in MetaTrader. So make sure if I take a trade what really my risk is per trade, not that that you take a huge position of course that's not wise or what you want. So make sure you understand gold lot sizes before you ever run the system and test it. Of course, it's for demo purposes. And yeah, y can you share the link in the chat here? So, everyone can click on the link and it will open up in your browser and then you have the system. Save it because it is only for people in the live webinars and hit me with questions after you got the link. Questions can be asked either just by unmuting yourself or texting. Whoa, lots of questions. First question, how do you test the target if conditions vary every year? Back testing isn't a good check. You can do it percentage based. Back in the days, we always had a big gold will move 100 points, but you can also make it percentage based, right? So 1% back in 2000 was different than 1% move in 2020 or 1% move in 2025. So I would test that. Make it percentage based. So maybe one year you target 1% is only 40 points and another year you want to have a bigger target. Any reason for the one hour time frame? We want to have a lot of setups. That's the main reason. You can also do the 4 hour. But if you have a very strict trading plan, let's say you only have three trades, then you will not bank that much because you want to stack positions. You want to enter, throw your stop loss to break even. So you're risk free and enter again and then stack in that direction. That's at least what I've seen is the best. So the 1 hour just gives you a lot of entries. You can also go to the 15 minute or lower, but that's a little bit aggressive for me. You can change it. Let's see. Luke, what do you mean with contents?",

    "text": "Uh, what are future plans with Perfect AI? Will there be more templates, indicators? We are working on so many different features. First of all, we have a team of AI developers helping us, which will be very nice for you to build on the platform, but also get feedback. So, if you have a question, you don't ask us, but you can be helped by us like as if I'm standing next to you helping you to build. That's one big feature. I cannot share all the features, but a lot about testing and all that. We have so many things in the pipeline now. Slowly I'll release it soon. There will also be a lot with in more templates but also you can build templates, you can share templates, you can share systems easily with others. We are also moving in that direction and more indicators. Yes, we are currently also busy with more indicators. Is there any tool on perfectionis to reverse engineer my MP5 strategy into a template? No, but we can always help you. You can private message us if you have something like that. If you need help building anything, just in the discord channel can just ask around. Yos shared his the template again. There you have it. Click on it and you'll have the code. I'm new to perfect. You have built a system that works great for prop firms past challenges. Yes. Yes. So yesterday someone asked this question in the discord. I shared a two-hour video I made about exactly the strategy I have used and many other people even in this call have used to pass FTMO challenges literally last month. So you could just watch that. It's a two-hour training and then you are pretty advanced. It's all free. Just want to ask since AI is open source can this reduce edge. Yeah. So building a strategy just based on AI doesn't work. You can ask chat whatever you want and it will give you a trading plan. If you don't back test it it's literally bad. AI will not be the holy grail for finding a profitable strategy. How we going to use AI is to really guide you guys to automate it quicker.",

    "text": "So if you have an idea maybe like this gold pattern, how do I build it that the system just helps you use these blocks, use these connections, this is and then you can test it. That is how AI will really change the game. But yeah, yeah, you can share the you can use the link just save the link keep working for you at least for a day or so. A lot of questions guys. >> You can't open the link. Any other anyone have a problem with that template link? I shared it in the perfect AI Discord channel. For some people it doesn't load on YouTube live probably the machine or a breakout system. Is it all right? Yo, can you share the MPL file here? Otherwise, but can share the MP5 file here again in the chat just to make sure everyone has it. Maybe too many people loading it. Yeah, that's also possible. >> Yeah, the link works fine. It's just that you have to log in first. And if you want the MQ5 file, can share that as well if you wish. >> It works. >> Yeah, it works. All right. Any other questions, guys? anyone here traded the gold run already or was this totally new information for me? My my main thing with my funded accounts is just I'm going to trade the gold run more aggressively. Maybe I would like to add a little something on the first question about how to define the target. Basically what I did, I made a list from 2017 onwards",

    "text": "up to basically last year to uh calculate the days it would move in a straight line and also the percentage move it would do over the years. And there's a pretty clear sign that over the last three years the move we're aiming to catch is around 9 to 15%. And the years before it was around six to seven. that there's a very clear increase in the percentage of move basically due to volatility and I think general trend nature of gold over the last years. So my suggestion would be to aim for slightly higher target maybe the same target as you would have done for 2023 or 2024 and don't look so much at 2017 2018 2019 because those years were very conservative. Yeah, like I said in the call, you can just go to Trading View or whatever charting platform you use and then just go to December and analyze this pattern. Almost every year it occurs and you just want to prepare for when it does. So indeed test everything you have said regarding targets. >> Let's see. Black Friday deal. I don't expect one to be there now. So we have right now we still have launch pricing anyways. So prices are lower than any other competition out there. So no black Friday stuff >> is expected at least. My final suggestion if we basically work through the questions is what you want to do is also look at the year 2020 because the run didn't really basically form the way we are looking at it normally and this will be one of the years where you want to test if your risk settings are according to your risk tolerance. Okay, because you have to have a plan in place if the run doesn't happen the way we expect it to happen. You want to have sort of a limit set as to how many positions you want to lose. That's not really something you can implement in",

What you can see in 2020 is there is a move, but it's so small. I think it's only like 40 points upwards and then it just fills. Yeah. You go a bit to the left. Yes, exactly. that bottom. It's that little move, but from the 19th of December, it's only 20 points or 40 points, I believe. Um, >> all right. >> Yeah, that's from December 1st, but a small run.

I want to turn it off manually or I decrease my risk or anything like that.\" >> Exactly. All right, guys. Last questions if there are any otherwise we wrap this up everyone asked the system can now still get it from the chat all right I don't see any new questions there's one back testing question you mean right GPU versus CPU we are not the owner of Metatrader 5 so we cannot really adjust much regarding how to test in MT5 but in the future also for more advanced developers we will move away from just MT5 and also be able to export our code in whatever code you want. When that is done, you can back test it way faster maybe on different platforms. For now, we it is what it is. Is it a bad idea to run multiple strategies at the same time on one account? No, we run multiple strategies on one account. Every algorithm is unique. So, they have a unique magic number. You can find that in the proactive AI settings of your project. If your magic number is unique, then you can run multiple strategies on one one. Yeah, exactly what Yost is also saying. Use unique codes, then it's fine. You can run multiple. If you have one",

    "text": "algorithm that is managing a trade this way and the other algorithm on the same account is managing trades the different way, the algorithm just looks at what trades are taken by what algorithm and then manages accordingly. with your risk increases, you can reduce your risk per trade, right? If you have a trending strategy that really capitalizes in a market with trends and you have also a mean reversion strategy that trades pullbacks, then running two strategies at one time will benefit because during trending markets, you'll bank, but also during choppy markets, the other one and when one strategy doesn't bank, the other one will be profitable. So you have just the more strategies you add normally if the correlation between strategies is lower then you have a more stable equity chart and stable returns. So yeah that makes sense. Okay. Yeah. So always look at what is my max draw down of what one strategy and then if you add another strategy combine them see what is now my max draw down. Did it increase then the correlation is high. If it decreased then correlation is probably lower or at least the strategies are helping each other. Then I wrap up this webinar now. Thank you all for joining. The next one will be around 11th of December. So put it in your calendar that we share a new strategy and again we do this whole lesson but then of course different topic. It will be the second Thursday in December. So I think that's 11th but I'm not totally sure but would check it out second Thursday of December. All right. There are past sessions yes but if you're not live you don't get the strategies so you can rewatch them and you can find them on the profactus AI YouTube channel. All right guys thank you and this one will be uploaded there as well by the way. Bye guys.",
