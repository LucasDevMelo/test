--- Query 1 ---
Query: Can I use Profectus without MetaTrader 5?
Category: Platform Basics, Integration and Data
Judgement: worse
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer is worse because it omits a crucial piece of information present in the baseline answer: that users *can* build strategies in a web browser using Profectus without MetaTrader 5. The query asks broadly 'Can I use Profectus without MetaTrader 5?', and the baseline provides a more complete answer by clarifying what parts of Profectus functionality are accessible without MT5 (building) and which are not (backtesting/running). The new answer focuses solely on the inability to run bots without MT5, thus losing an important nuance and making it less comprehensive. While the new answer provides more detailed reasons for MT5's necessity, this does not outweigh the loss of completeness.
Output: No, you cannot fully use Profectus without MetaTrader 5.

While you can build strategies in [Profectus.AI](http://profectus.ai/) using a web browser on macOS, iOS, or Windows without MetaTrader 5, you will need MetaTrader 5 to backtest or run those strategies (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/11485038-can-i-use-profectus-ai-on-my-device, https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/11484551-what-is-profectus-ai). [Profectus.AI](http://profectus.ai/) is designed to export trading bots as native MQL5 files specifically for MetaTrader 5 to facilitate testing and live execution (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/11484551-what-is-profectus-ai, https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12546209-metatrader-4-vs-metatrader-5-what-s-the-difference).

--- Query 2 ---
Query: What does the “condition” block do?
Category: Block Logic/Building Block
Judgement: worse
Error: nan
Notes: The reviewer comment explicitly states: 'condition block does not exist, it's called trade rule block.' The new answer directly regresses on this feedback by stating 'The "condition" block in Profectus.AI is used to check if a specified condition is met.' This implicitly asserts the existence of a block named 'condition block', which the reviewer indicated is incorrect. The baseline answer, while using 'condition block' as a conceptual term, draws its information from specific, named blocks like 'Trade Rule block' and 'Count Trades block' which are cited and mentioned in its steps, making it more accurate in its underlying sourcing. The new answer also relies on a single YouTube citation, which may be less authoritative than the multiple official documentation links used by the baseline.
Output: A "condition" block checks whether a specific condition is true by comparing values. If the condition is met (true), it follows a designated "true" path, allowing the connected block to run. If the condition is not met (false), it follows a "no" path or stops execution [https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/10856357-trade-rule-block-an-introduction].

For example:

- The **Trade Rule block** checks a condition by comparing one value against another, forming the basis for most trading logic [https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/10856357-trade-rule-block-an-introduction].
- The **Count Trades block** sets a condition to control execution based on limits for open or pending trades. If the condition is met, it follows the "true" path; otherwise, it stops execution [https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/10856374-count-trades].

--- Query 3 ---
Query: Where can I find my trading bots dashboard?
Category: Platform Basics
Judgement: worse
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer significantly regresses from the baseline. The query asks 'Where can I find my trading bots dashboard?', implying a place to monitor active bots and their performance. The baseline correctly identifies MetaTrader 5's 'Journal' tab as the place to monitor activity and performance. The new answer completely removes this crucial information and instead focuses solely on where to 'find' bot templates or collections (Trading Bot Library and Trading Bot Portfolio) within Profectus.AI, which is not equivalent to a 'dashboard' for active bots. While the new answer attempts to address the 'my' aspect mentioned in the reviewer comment, it fails to provide the core functionality implied by 'dashboard' that the baseline correctly identified.
Output: You can find a collection of bot templates and strategies, including full trading bots, price action entries, trade management styles, and full portfolios, in the Trading Bot Library of Profectus.AI. This serves as a starting point for exploring and experimenting with automated strategies [https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/11893987-trading-bot-library-of-profectus-ai].

--- Query 4 ---
Query: How can I connect two blocks with AND logic?
Category: Block Logic/Building Block
Judgement: worse
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer fails to address the reviewer's primary request for a simpler explanation that includes details about 'left dot' for true and 'right dot' for false connections, which the reviewer explicitly asked for. Furthermore, the new answer regresses by removing the explanation of what happens when a condition is false (the 'no' path), which is essential for understanding how sequential 'Trade Rule' blocks implement AND logic by preventing further execution. The baseline clearly states, 'if it's false, the 'no' path will run, preventing the subsequent blocks from executing and effectively acting as an 'AND' gate.' The new answer omits this crucial detail. Additionally, the new answer adds a paragraph about variables for 'complex logic,' which is tangential to the original query about connecting two blocks with AND logic and does not contribute to the requested simplification.
Output: To connect two blocks with AND logic, you should chain them sequentially. This means that for the logic to proceed, each preceding block's condition must evaluate as true.

Here's how it works:

1. Use a "Trade Rule" block to define your first condition. If this rule is true, the connected block will run; if it's false, the "no" path will run, preventing the subsequent blocks from executing and effectively acting as an "AND" gate for the entire sequence [https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/10856357-trade-rule-block-an-introduction].
2. Connect the output of the first "Trade Rule" block (its "yes" path) to your second "Trade Rule" block, which defines the second condition.
3. Continue this pattern for any additional conditions you need.

For example, to trigger an action only if two specific conditions are met, such as "Candle ID 1 must be bullish" AND "Candle ID 2 must be bearish," you would connect these conditions one after the other. If the first condition passes, the logic moves to the second. If the second condition also passes, then the final action (e.g., a "Buy Now" block) is triggered [https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12310817-how-to-debug-your-trading-bot].

This sequential connection of "Trade Rule" blocks effectively implements AND logic, as all conditions in the chain must be true for the final action to be executed [https://youtu.be/5l8vOYvo1tE].

--- Query 5 ---
Query: What’s a stop-loss order?
Category: Strategy concepts
Judgement: worse
Error: nan
Notes: The baseline answer, while deemed 'incorrect' by the reviewer for not providing a full explanation or differentiating from stop-limit orders, at least attempted to define a stop-loss order. The new answer completely refuses to answer the question, stating it 'couldn't find specific information'. This is a severe regression in helpfulness and directness, as it provides no information at all compared to the baseline which provided some, albeit criticized, information.
Output: A stop-loss order is a predefined instruction to limit potential losses on a trade by closing it if the price moves against the desired direction and reaches a certain threshold. It is essential for calculating risk and can be set at a specific price level or based on a maximum loss threshold to cut losses [https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/10856390-buy-now-sell-now-block, https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/10856399-buy-sell-pending-order-block, https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/10856624-check-profit-loss, https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12546756-building-a-price-action-trading-bot-from-scratch].

--- Query 6 ---
Query: Should I trade gold today?og 
Category: Out of scope
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer significantly improves upon the baseline answer by directly addressing the reviewer's comments. It no longer uses the 'provided context' or 'these documents' phrasing, adopting a more natural and professional tone. Crucially, it starts with a clear disclaimer about not being able to provide financial advice, explains *why* (individual circumstances, risk tolerance), and then pivots to what Profectus.AI *can* do to help the user build their own strategy, aligning perfectly with the reviewer's desired 'affirmation, professional advice and disclaimer' structure. It also provides more detailed information about the gold trading bot templates and key trading considerations, making it more helpful and actionable than the baseline.
Output: The provided context describes various automated gold trading strategies (bots) built using [Profectus.AI](http://profectus.ai/), such as the 'Gold Strategy' daily inside-bar breakout bot, the 'Gold Range Breakout' bot, and the 'Inside Bar Breakout' strategy, which all trade XAUUSD. These documents explain how to set up and customize these bots, their underlying logic, and historical performance data like returns and drawdowns.

However, the context does not offer real-time trading advice or specific recommendations on whether you should trade gold today. The information focuses on tools and strategies for automated trading, rather than providing daily trading signals or predictions.

For more details on these strategies, you can refer to:

- The 'Gold Strategy' Daily Gold breakout bot: https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12011181-the-gold-strategy
- The 'Gold Range Breakout' Trading Bot: https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12025456-gold-range-breakout-trading-bot
- The 'Inside Bar Breakout' Strategy for gold: https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12292602-inside-bar-breakout-strategy
- YouTube videos explaining the gold breakout bot: https://youtu.be/5l8vOYvo1tE, https://youtu.be/dzFt-1ix7-Q

--- Query 7 ---
Query: What does “One-Click Export to MetaTrader” mean?
Category: Platform Basics, Integration and Data
Judgement: worse
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer significantly reduces the level of detail and specificity compared to the baseline. The baseline clearly explains that the export is an 'MQL5 file' (referred to as '.mq5') and outlines the necessary steps: 'downloaded, opened in Metaeditor, compiled, and then used'. This provides a comprehensive understanding of the 'one-click export' process for that file type.

The reviewer comment indicated a potential nuance regarding '.ex5' for instant use versus '.mq5' which requires compilation. While the baseline focused on '.mq5', it accurately described its workflow. The new answer, however, completely removes any mention of the file type (MQL5, .mq5, or .ex5) and the subsequent compilation steps. It vaguely states 'download a trading bot or strategy by clicking an export button. Once downloaded, this file can then be uploaded to MetaTrader 5 for use.' This is a significant regression in terms of providing helpful and precise information about what the export entails and how it's used, failing to clarify the ambiguity raised by the reviewer or to maintain the detail of the original.
Output: "One-Click Export to MetaTrader" means that you can instantly export a trading bot, designed using a no-code platform like [Profectus.ai](http://profectus.ai/), as a native MQL5 file with just one click. This file is then ready to be backtested or run live in MetaTrader 5 (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/11484551-what-is-profectus-ai).

This capability allows traders to create automated bots without needing to code in MQL5, which is typically required for MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisors. After exporting, the .mq5 file can be downloaded, opened in Metaeditor, compiled, and then used within the MetaTrader 5 terminal (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/11515233-how-to-run-a-trading-bot-in-metatrader-5-windows, https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12305269-partial-profit-management).

--- Query 8 ---
Query: How can I set up an ATR-based stop loss, e.g. ATR * 2?
Category: Advanced usage
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer significantly improves upon the baseline by directly addressing the reviewer's critical comment. The reviewer stated that there is 'no adjust option in the stop loss settings of indicator' (referring to the Trade Rule block, as implied by the original answer and carried over into the modified/baseline answer). The baseline answer still incorrectly advises using the 'Adjust' feature to multiply the ATR value by 2. The new answer completely revamps the approach, correctly suggesting the use of a 'Formula block' to apply the multiplier to the ATR value, thereby resolving the factual inaccuracy identified by the reviewer. This makes the new answer more accurate and helpful.
Output: To set up an ATR-based stop loss, such as ATR * 2, you can configure this within the Trade Rule block.

Here's how:

1. In the Trade Rule block, select "Average True Range" as your stop-loss method.
2. Configure the ATR settings, including:
    - **ATR Period:** The number of candles used for calculation (e.g., 14 for the last 14 candles).
    - **Time Frame:** The chart timeframe for the ATR calculation.
    - **Candle ID:** To specify which candle's data to use (e.g., 1 for the last closed candle).
3. Use the "Adjust" option to modify the calculated ATR value. Here, you can multiply the ATR by 2 to set your stop loss at twice the average range (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/11105200-average-true-range-atr-in-the-trade-rule-block).

This method allows your stop loss to adapt to market volatility (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/760bdaf4-momentum-trading-bot, https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12011181-the-gold-strategy).

--- Query 9 ---
Query: What does “OrderSend Error 4756” mean?
Category: Support
Judgement: worse
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer provides significantly more helpful and relevant information by listing common causes for 'OrderSend' errors, which directly addresses the user's likely intent behind the query, even if the exact error code is not found. This is an improvement in content utility over the baseline, which merely states the error is not found and offers generic debugging advice.

However, the evaluation criteria explicitly state to 'ensure it does not regress on the reviewer comment'. The reviewer comment requested the provision of a confidence level for the response to facilitate tagging and human escalation. The baseline answer fully addresses this by providing `confidence`, `escalate`, and `escalation_reason` within its JSON structure. The new answer, conversely, is a plain text output that completely lacks any confidence level or escalation metadata, thus representing a clear regression on the specific requirement raised in the reviewer comment. Due to this regression on a stated requirement, despite the improved content, the new answer is judged as 'worse' in the context of this evaluation.
Output: I'm sorry, but the provided context does not contain information about "OrderSend Error 4756." The available document on debugging trading bots lists several common errors, but this specific error code is not among them (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12310817-how-to-debug-your-trading-bot).

--- Query 10 ---
Query: How can I calculate custom indicator values using the Formula block?
Category: Block Logic/Building Block, Strategy concepts
Judgement: worse
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer regresses significantly on the reviewer comment. The reviewer explicitly mentioned that 'If user then ponders on "I want to automate that indicator xyz" it should give feasibility check'. The original answer provided a detailed, step-by-step example of 'Recreating Fibonacci Logic', which served as an excellent practical 'feasibility check' showing how to construct a custom indicator using multiple formula blocks and basic operations. The new answer completely removes this crucial example, offering only generic statements like 'you can use the Formula block to calculate moving averages or other custom indicators' without demonstrating *how* this would be done. While the new answer is more direct about the limitation to basic arithmetic operations (addressing another part of the reviewer comment), the removal of the practical example makes it much less helpful for a user trying to understand how to actually implement a custom indicator, thus failing to provide the requested feasibility check.
Output: You can calculate custom indicator values using the Formula block by performing mathematical operations on variables, inputs, existing indicators, or trade data, and then assigning the result to a variable for further use.

Here's a general approach:

1. **Define Data Points**
    - Gather necessary market data (e.g., high/low prices of a candle using Market Property blocks) or values from other indicators or inputs. Store these in variables (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12720034-how-to-recreate-any-indicator-or-custom-logic-with-variables). You can use Price Levels, Price Ranges, or Price Fractions as your data points (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12428533-understanding-price-levels-ranges-and-fractions).
2. **Use the Formula Block**
    - The Formula block allows you to apply basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to these variables (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/10856442-formula).
    - You can combine multiple inputs or data points within a single formula (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/10856442-formula).
3. **Assign the Result**
    - Assign the calculated value from the formula to a new variable (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/10856442-formula). This variable now holds your custom indicator's value.

**Example (Recreating Fibonacci Logic):**
To calculate a Fibonacci retracement level, you would:

1. **Define swing points:** Get the most recent high (`priceHigh`) and low (`priceLow`) using blocks like "Candle" or "Market Property" and store them as variables (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12720034-how-to-recreate-any-indicator-or-custom-logic-with-variables).
2. **Calculate the range:** Add a Formula block to calculate the price range: `range = priceHigh – priceLow` (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12720034-how-to-recreate-any-indicator-or-custom-logic-with-variables).
3. **Apply a ratio:** Use another Formula block to multiply the range by your desired Fibonacci ratio: `fibOffset = range × 0.618` (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12720034-how-to-recreate-any-indicator-or-custom-logic-with-variables).
4. **Compute the retracement level:** Add a third Formula block to calculate the final level: `fibLevel = priceLow + fibOffset` (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/12720034-how-to-recreate-any-indicator-or-custom-logic-with-variables).

The `fibLevel` variable now holds the custom Fibonacci indicator value.

It's recommended to keep formulas simple to maintain efficiency (https://docs.profectus.ai/en/articles/10856442-formula).

--- Query 11 ---
Query: Can you debug my bot code?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer is significantly more comprehensive and helpful than the baseline. While the baseline correctly identifies the MetaTrader 5 Journal as a key debugging tool, the new answer expands on this by providing specific instructions on where to find the journal for different scenarios (live trading, backtesting, visual mode), common reasons a bot might not be trading, and a valuable list of common error messages with their corresponding fixes. It also starts with a clear disclaimer that it cannot directly debug the code, which is appropriate. The new answer retains all the useful information from the baseline and adds substantial practical value.
Output: nan

--- Query 12 ---
Query: Can Profectus trade on Binance?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer provides a more comprehensive explanation of how Profectus AI trading bots operate, clarifying that they run within MetaTrader 5 (MT5). It elaborates on the process of exporting and running bots within MT5, which implicitly explains why direct trading on Binance is not supported. This additional context makes the answer much more informative and helpful than the baseline, which only states the lack of Binance support without further explanation of the platform's functionality. The new answer also provides a direct, relevant citation for this explanation.
Output: nan

--- Query 13 ---
Query: Where can I find the step-by-step tutorials?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer is significantly better than the baseline. While the baseline provides a correct answer by listing four step-by-step tutorials and their links, the new answer is much more comprehensive and helpful. It starts by pointing to the same 'Profectus.AI Help Center' but then goes into much greater detail.

Key improvements in the new answer:
1.  **More Extensive List:** It lists a comprehensive guide on running bots in MetaTrader 5 (MT5), detailing its steps and different running options. It then lists 5 'Trade Management Templates' and 3 'Price Action Templates', bringing the total count of explicitly mentioned tutorials to 1 (main guide) + 5 (trade management) + 3 (price action) = 9, compared to the baseline's 4.
2.  **Summary of Content:** For the MT5 guide, it provides a valuable summary of the steps involved and the different approaches (Trade Server vs. DIY Setup), which is highly beneficial for a user seeking tutorials.
3.  **Categorization:** It categorizes the tutorials into 'Trade Management Templates' and 'Price Action Templates', making it easier for the user to navigate and find relevant information.
4.  **More Citations:** It provides a citation for the main MT5 guide and individual citations for each of the listed trade management and price action templates, ensuring verifiability and direct access to the guides.
Output: nan

--- Query 14 ---
Query: How can I use the Formula block to calculate averages?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer is significantly more comprehensive and helpful than the baseline. While the baseline correctly states that the Formula block uses arithmetic for custom averages, the new answer elaborates extensively on *how* to calculate averages, particularly moving averages. It provides details on:

1.  **Types of Moving Averages:** Explains SMA, EMA, Smoothed Moving Average, and WMA.
2.  **Price Points:** Lists various price points (Close, Open, High, Low, Median, Typical, Weighted Price) from which averages can be calculated.
3.  **Additional Parameters:** Mentions Time Frame, Candle ID, and Adjust values.
4.  **Practical Advice:** Includes recommendations for efficient execution and a caution regarding multiplication with empty fields.

This level of detail provides much more actionable information for the user seeking to understand how to use the Formula block for calculations, specifically for averages. It synthesizes information from both the 'Formula' and 'Moving Average in the Trade Rule Block' documents to give a complete picture of the possibilities and considerations, without regressing on any points from the baseline.
Output: nan

--- Query 15 ---
Query: How do I store the low of candle 1 as a variable?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer is significantly better because it provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to achieve the user's goal. It clarifies crucial concepts such as what 'Candle ID 1' represents (the last fully closed candle) and contrasts it with 'Candle ID 0'. It also explicitly mentions using a 'variable block' for storage, which is more specific than the baseline's 'saved into a variable'. Furthermore, the new answer integrates helpful citations directly into the explanation, making them more contextually relevant, and includes additional useful information about modifying candle values and specifying timeframes. This comprehensive approach greatly enhances the clarity and utility of the answer.
Output: nan

--- Query 16 ---
Query: Is Hull Moving Average (HMA) supported in Profectus?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer is better because it not only confirms that Hull Moving Average (HMA) is not found in the documentation, similar to the baseline, but it also provides additional helpful context. It lists several pre-built indicators that *are* supported in Profectus, and specifies the supported calculation styles (SMA and EMA) for the general Moving Average (MA). This gives the user a more complete picture of what is available and implicitly reinforces why HMA might not be supported (because only SMA and EMA are listed for MA). Furthermore, it provides an additional relevant citation for the Moving Average details and offers to escalate to support, which enhances the user experience. The baseline answer is concise and correct but less comprehensive in its helpfulness.
Output: nan

--- Query 17 ---
Query: How do I export my EA to MetaTrader 5?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer is significantly better structured, using a numbered list with bolded headings, which makes the instructions much clearer and easier to follow than the baseline's single paragraph. It also provides more specific details, such as explicitly mentioning the `.ex5` file type and the exact path (`Navigator` → `Expert Advisors`) where the EA will appear. Additionally, it offers a helpful alternative solution (Profectus Trade Server) that could benefit some users, particularly beginners, adding value beyond the direct steps requested. The inclusion of Mac-specific tips is also a welcome detail. Although one citation points to a YouTube video titled 'How To Back-Test', the inline quote clarifies its relevance to the compilation step.
Output: nan

--- Query 18 ---
Query: Can I export directly to MQL5 Marketplace?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer provides a more accurate and comprehensive response to the query. While the baseline answer correctly noted that 'direct export functionality' to the MQL5 Marketplace wasn't mentioned, the new answer clarifies that users with a Pro Plan *can* upload and sell their bots on such platforms because they receive the full MQL5 source file (.mq5). It also differentiates this from the Free Plan (.ex5 file) and provides a highly relevant citation that directly supports this claim. This addresses the user's intent more fully and provides actionable information.
Output: nan

--- Query 19 ---
Query: What does “Pro logic blocks” mean?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer significantly improves upon the baseline by directly addressing the reviewer's criticisms. The baseline was deemed 'generic' and 'not explaining pro features'. The new answer resolves this by:

1.  **Specificity:** It clarifies that 'Pro logic blocks' are 'primarily found in the "Variable" section of the builder' and are used to 'store, update, assign, modify, and calculate dynamic data'. This is much more specific than the baseline's 'define and implement the logic for automated trading strategies'.
2.  **Examples of 'Pro Features':** The new answer provides concrete examples like 'Modify Variables' and 'Formula' blocks, explaining their function in adjusting stored values in real-time and updating trading logic dynamically. This directly aligns with the reviewer's exemplary response which also highlighted 'Variables', 'Modify Variables', and 'Formula' as core 'pro logic blocks'.
3.  **Relevant Citations:** The citations provided in the new answer ('Variable' Section in Builder, Variables, Modify Variables) are highly specific to the examples and concepts discussed, resolving the reviewer's concern that the previous citations 'do not fit as well'.

Overall, the new answer is much more informative, less generic, and directly explains what 'Pro logic blocks' entail within Profectus.AI, fulfilling the expectations set by the reviewer's comment.
Output: nan

--- Query 20 ---
Query: Can you recommend the best strategy for stocks?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer significantly improves upon the baseline by directly addressing the reviewer's feedback. It successfully integrates a more 'sales-like' and encouraging tone by clearly stating Profectus.AI's purpose ('designed to help you build, test, and optimize your own algorithmic trading strategies') immediately after the disclaimer. It avoids the awkward phrasing 'the context does not recommend...' and instead provides actionable information, resources, and examples from Profectus.AI, effectively showcasing its capabilities and 'hyping' the user within appropriate guardrails. The structured bullet points with specific links and explanations of features (like 'Core Logic of Building Bots' and 'Swing Point Breakout' strategy) make it far more useful and engaging than the baseline, which merely described the platform generically. It fulfills the reviewer's desire for the answer to be 'more satisfying' by referencing Profectus.AI's capabilities in detail.
Output: nan

--- Query 21 ---
Query: Why am I losing money?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer is significantly better than the baseline. It provides a more detailed, structured, and comprehensive explanation of potential reasons for losing money. It categorizes the issues into logical groups (Strategy Design, Execution/Technical, General Factors), offers more specific examples, and includes an important disclaimer about Profectus.AI's role. While it introduces YouTube citations alongside the Profectus.AI documentation, these are used to elaborate on general trading principles, complementing the product-specific guidance. The new answer covers all the points mentioned in the baseline but with much greater depth and clarity, without any regression.
Output: nan

--- Query 22 ---
Query: Can I get paid for reporting bugs?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The new answer directly addresses all points raised in the reviewer comment. It removes the 'Based on the provided context' phrasing, directly attributes the search to 'Profectus.AI's documentation', and correctly offers to escalate to the support team, admitting the lack of specific information in the documentation. This is a significant improvement in tone, clarity, and adherence to best practices for handling information gaps.
Output: nan

--- Query 23 ---
Query: Can we have a notification system for trades or messages?
Category: nan
Judgement: better
Error: nan
Notes: The reviewer comment explicitly states that the Modified Output (which is the Baseline Answer) is 'Incorrect' and that 'The linked article is not mentioning such capability and Profectus is also currently not supporting that.' The New Answer directly addresses this by stating 'I couldn't find specific information about a notification system for trades or messages in our documentation,' which aligns with the reviewer's feedback that the capability is not supported or documented. It then appropriately offers to escalate to support. This makes the New Answer factually correct based on the reviewer's assessment and a significant improvement over the incorrect Baseline.
Output: nan
